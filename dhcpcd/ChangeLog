12/31/02 - v.1.3.22-pl4
	Peter Poeml <poeml@suse.de> submitted patches to:
	1. enable support for Token Ring.
	2. disable second DHCP_DISCOVER message. S.V - added "-S" option to dhcpcd command
	   line to make second DHCP_DISCOVER message optional.
	3. Make dhcpcd  write to the console if syslogd is not running only with
	   "-d" DebugFlag.
	Robert Whaley <rwhaley@applieddata.net> submitted patch to elimited potential
	race condition between setting up the setjmp for dhcpReboot and the sigalarm handler.
	Ian Sharpe <ian.sharpe@sharpe-practice.co.uk> submitted patch to handle situations
	with DHCP server changing lease or T1,T2 times from renewal to renewal.
	Jamey Hicks <jamey.hicks@hp.com> pointed out the setting of the netmask for
	static route still doesn't always work correctly. Wrote "getgenmask" function
	to try to deduce the netmask for static routes - S.V.
	Per-Olof Pettersson <peope@peope.net> suggested "-G" option to prevent
	dhcpcd from installing default routes. Expanded "-G" to include optional
	[gateway] parameter for ip address of default router - S.V. The "-G" option
	has also been added by Peter Poeml <poeml@suse.de> in one of the patches he sent.
	S.V.- moved parts of the code from client.c into cache.c and dhcpconfig.c files.

09/30/02 - v.1.3.22-pl3
	Duke Cho <duke@embeddedweb.co.kr> submitted patch for dhcpSendAndRecv() to scan
	for begining of IP header in the received Ethernet frame rather than assume
	it begins right after Ethernet header. It made dhcpcd work for ARM7TDMI cored SoC
	boards.
	Marc Beuchat <marc@siana.ch> submitted patch to open 0,1,2 file descriptors
	at the start of dhcpcd if they are closed as in a case when dhcpcd starts from
	pcmcia-cs network script.

09/21/02 - v.1.3.22-pl2
	James Hicks <Jamey.Hicks@hp.com> submitted patch to set the netmask properly
	for static routes provided by the DHCP server.
	Michal Dobes <dobes@tesnet.cz> pointed out there could be situation with
	many dhcpcd clients starting at the same time on different machines on the
	same network in which case they will generate the DHCP messages with the
	same XID and potentially configure the same IP addresses. Fixed by
	including CLientHwAddr (MAC address) into the seed for srandom(). -S.V.
	David Fallon <davef@d2.com> recomended changing sbindir to = ${exec_prefix}/sbin
	rather than ${prefix} in Makefile.am. Also changed docdir=/usr/doc. -S.V.
	Henning Spruth <henning.spruth@epost.de> suggested replacing
	getuid() call with geteuid() in dhcpcd.c to enable setuid tools
	to launch dhcpcd.
	David Oleszkiewicz <davole@us.ibm.com> pointed out "logger" should
	be used in dhcpcd.exe script instead of direct write to a log files.
	Tobias Blomberg <tobias.blomberg@home.se> pointed out to a bug report at
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65515
	what appears to be dhcpcd cache overriding command line options -I and -i.
	The related problem has been also reported by Øyvind Bakksjø
	<oyvind@bakksjo.no>. Fixed by calling clientIDsetup and classIDsetup
	even after successfull cache read.
	Kosbar, Kurt Louis <kosbar@umr.edu> submitted patch to fix a case of
	dhcpcd client crash because of some DHCP server sending no dhcpMessageType
	field in DHCP message.
	Simon Kelley <simon@thekelleys.org.uk> pointed out at security bug in dhcpcd
	related to *.info file. A malicios administrator of untrusted DHCP server
	may execute any command with root privileges on DHCP client machine by
	sending the command enclosed in shell metacharacters in one of DHCP server
	provided options. Fixed by enclosing all strings in *.info file into single
	quotes and replacing any single quotes found in DHCP option strings
	with space. - S.V.

01/20/02 - v.1.3.22-pl1
	S.V. - added support for virtual interfaces (eth0:1, eth1:2, etc)
	inside dhcpcd itself. The "external" support (with external script
	using *.info file) has been added in v.1.3.22-pl0.

01/19/02 - v.1.3.22-pl0
	Scott Gifford <sgifford@tir.com> and Victor McSmith <vmcs@mail.ru>
	suggested letting custom scripts instead of dhcpcd do all the
	interface configuration work using DHCP info secured by dhcpcd
	and stored in the *.info file.
	Pramod Immaneni <pramod@aligo.com> suggested adding -L option to
	dhcpcd to enable writing configuration information into a given *.info
	file to be later used by other scripts. He also suggested modifying
	-T option to save configuration information rather than just exiting after
	DHCP negotiation sequence.
	S.V. - the above proposals inspired the following changes to dhcpcd:

	1. "-L <ConfigDir>" option has been added. Dhcpcd will store *.info,
	   *.cache files under <ConfigDir> rather than default /etc/dhcpc.
	2. *.pid file has moved from under /var/run to under <ConfigDir>
	   (default /etc/dhcpc) subdirectory.
	3. -T option behaviour has been modified to include writing
	   *.info, *.cache, *.pid files under <ConfigDir>, and executing
	   *.exe script in the same manner as without -T option.
	   Now with -T option dhcpcd will do everything except actually
	   configuring interface or changing any files under /etc.
	   Also now with -T option dhcpcd will not exit at the end of DHCP
	   negotiation sequence but will go into background and attempt
	   to renew the lease as usual.
	   -T option in conjunction with -L <ConfigDir> and -I <ClientID> will
	   enable users to negotiate/renew multiple IP addresses using the same
	   dummy interface.
	   It should also enable configuration of virtual interfaces.
	4. <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd.exe script calling convention has changed. Now
	   dhcpcd will pass the path to *.info file as first argument and "up/down/new"
	   keyword as second argument. The third argument is optional
	   debugFlag "-d" passed from dhcpcd command line. See sample dhcpcd.exe
	   script supplied with distribution.
	5. "-c <ExecFile>" option has been given second life and its behaviour
	   has slightly changed. Now <ExecFile> script will be executed instead of
	   default <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd.exe and in the same manner as
	   <ConfigDir>/dhcpcd.exe script (see Item 4 above).
	6. The following lines has been added to *.info file written by
	   dhcpcd:
	   INTERFACE=<interface>	(e.g. INTERFACE=eth1)
	   CLASSID=<class_id_string>	(e.g. CLASSID="Linux 2.4.14 i686")
	   CLIENTID=<client_id_string>	(e.g. CLIENT_ID=10:32:C3:37:25:14 or
					      CLIENT_ID="test1")
	7. dhcpcd now will rename previous *.info file to *.info.old

	Other changes:
	Tim Wright <timw@polyserve.com> submitted patch to prevent dhcpcd
	from altering network interface flags that it should not change.
	Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> submitted patch to dhcpcd.spec file
	to fix the installation directories.
	Tim Goodwin <tjg@star.le.ac.uk>	suggested using full-qualified
	host names rather than truncating them at first ".".

12/31/01 - v.1.3.21-pl2
	D. Hugh Redelmeier <hugh@mimosa.com> pointed out a problem with
	binding udpFooSocket in client.c to address 0.0.0.0 port 68 and
	exiting with error status if binding fails as in a case of more
	than one dhcpcd process. This effectively prevented dhcpcd from
	running on more than one interface. Fixed for now by disabling
	error exit in a case udpFooSocket binding fails. Perhaps a better
	solution is needed.
	Thomas Aeby <tomae@sfi.ch> pointed out nisDomainName should not
	be used in /etc/resolv.conf file. Fixed.
	Roger Maclean <rmaclean@marchnetworks.com> suggested to increase
	"time since bootup" parameter in DHCP message to 10, otherwise
	dhcpcd may not get an IP address from WinNT DHCP server.
	Jani Averbach <jaa@cc.jyu.fi> suggested changes to Makefile.am to
	make ./configure accept installation options.
	Yaacov Akiba Slama <slamaya@yahoo.com> submitted a patch to make use
	dhcp-spoof feature of adsl modems/routers. The patch sets netmask to
	255.255.255.255 in a case the dhcpConfig routine fails to set it to
	the netmask supplied by DHCP server.

10/13/01 - v.1.3.21-pl1
	Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> submitted patch for dhcpcd.spec.in
	file to fix  "rpm -ta dhcpcd-1.3.21-pl1.tar.gz"  RPM package creation.

10/09/01 - v.1.3.21-pl0
	Toralf Lund <toralf@kscanners.com> submitted patch to add
	support for NIS and NTP server options in DHCP. -Y and -N
	flags have been added to dhcpcd command line. Dhcpcd now creates
	/etc/yp.conf and /etc/ntp.conf files unless -Y or -N
	options are specified (see dhcpcd manual page). Among other things
	in the patch: dhcpcd saves the hostname and domainname of the host
	and restores it upon exit; dhcpcd now retries HWADDR_TRIES times
	to retrieve NIC MAC address in dhcpStart().
	Jarno Huuskonen <Jarno.Huuskonen@uku.fi> pointed out
	dhcpcd sets mode of the pid file corresponding to the umask of
	the calling process which may be a security risk if calling
	process has umask 000 which happens when dhcpcd runs from APM
	suspend/resume. Fixed by setting umask of dhcpcd process to 022 at
	the very beginning in dhcpcd.c.
	Olivier Baudron <Olivier.Baudron@ens.fr> suggested using just one
	dhcpcd.exe script, which is to run every time interface is
	configured or brought down. The interface name will be passed as
	first parameter and configuration state as second parameter to the
	script. So /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe script is invoked as
	/etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd.exe <interface> <up|down|new>  [ip_address] [-d]
	Second parameter has value "up" when interface is brought up with
	the same IP address as before, "new" when interface is brought up
	with new IP address, and "down" when interface is brought down when
	dhcpcd exits. This usage to the executable script was suggested by
	Scott Gifford <sgifford@tir.com>.
****	This version requires rewrite of dhcpcd*.exe script(s) as it is
	incompatible with previous versions of dhcpcd.

10/08/01 - v.1.3.20-pl2
        Fabrizio Gennari <fabrizio.gennari@philips.com> reported
        dhcpcd could not add a static route supplied by his DHCP server. He suggested
        changing a line in client.c
        rtent.rt_flags      =      RTF_UP|RTF_HOST;
        to
        rtent.rt_flags      =      RTF_UP|RTF_HOST|RTF_GATEWAY;
        which fixed the problem for him. I will give it a shot .. with RoadRunner
        no matter how much you screw dhcpcd, it always works ..
        Simon Oliver <simon.oliver@umist.ac.uk> reported an interesting case
        if DHCP server supplying dhcpAddrLeaseTime>0 and dhcpT1value=0 and
        dhcpT2value=0 which made dhcpcd go mad about lease renewal. Fixed by
        checking for dhcpT1value=0 and dhcpT2value=0 in client.c

10/01/01 - v.1.3.20-pl1
	Matteo Frigo <athena@fftw.org> pointed out a bug in client.c:
	in a case of class A network and DHCP server not supplying subnet mask
	dhcpcd did not zero out second octet in subnet mask.
	Elliot Lee <sopwith@redhat.com> submitted patches:
	  1. dhcpcd to accept IEEE 802 TokenRing interface (not sure if this one
	     will actually make dhcpcd work with TokenRing, since
	     dhcpcd builds messages on top of Ethernet frames)
	  2. make some globally defined variables to be local
	  3. use nis domain name along with dns domain name in search string of
	     /etc/resolv.conf file.
	  4. run a script when interface gets configured in addition to
	     /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-eth0.exe script which runs only when IP address
	     changes. S.V. - made the script name /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd_up-eth0.exe
	S.V - make dhcpcd run a script when interface goes down, the script is
	     /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd_down-eth0.exe. This was also suggested by
	     Jason Bodnar <jbodnar@buzzard.kdi.com>
	Craig Lawson <craig.lawson@symphony-systems.com> pointed out to a bug
	in dhcpcd when it runs on multiple interfaces. When dhcpcd exits
	it tries to restore resolv.conf.sv back to resolv.conf even if
	dhcpcd did not rename it at first. Fixed.
	Olivier Baudron <Olivier.Baudron@ens.fr> submitted patch to bind a
	datagram socket to udp port 68 to prevent icmp error message from
	the kernel. This problem has also been report by Robert Paluszak
	<paluszak@nycap.rr.com>.
	S.V.- cleaned up "configure" scripts to make sure ./configure will
	create the Makefile with correct installation paths.

04/06/01 - v.1.3.20-pl0
	S.V - removed 0x0 from ClientID and ClassID options

04/03/01 - v.1.3.19-pl9
	Young, Jeremy <jeremy.young@cccnetsys.com> pointed out
	to a bug introduced in v.1.3.19-pl6 which resulted in
	7-byte long MAC address with 0x0 at the end. Fixed.

03/10/01 - v.1.3.19-pl8
	Rune Torgersen <rune36@home.com> pointed out
	at a bug introduced in v.1.3.19-pl7 with "rootPath"
	option. The dhcpParamRequest had to be changed to 14.
	The bug probably disabled "-h hostname" option to dhcpcd
	in v.1.3.19-pl7.

02/22/01 - v.1.3.19-pl7
	Chris Petro <petro@auctionwatch.com>
	submitted patch to disable processing of
	"routersOnSubnet" DHCP option if it is not
	provided by DHCP server, as "routersOnSubnet" is
	indeed optional.
	Jason A. Pattie <pattieja@pcxperience.com>
	submitted patch to include "rootPath" DHCP option.
	Peter Poeml <poeml@suse.de> submitted patch
	to work around a problem with dhcpcd setting
	hostname when it is not provided by DHCP server if
	there is no initial /etc/resolv.conf file to
	be able to resolv hostname from obtained IP address.

01/14/01 - v.1.3.19-pl6
	Simon Byrnand <sbyrnand@xtra.co.nz> reported the compilation
	on older kernels broke again somewhere in pl3-pl5.
	Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> submitted patch to fix the
	problem with compilation on older kernels.
	S.V - added 0x0 to the end of ClientID and ClassID
	options in the DHCP message.

12/21/00 - v.1.3.19-pl5
        Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org> submitted patch:
	README:
	- Mention that MediaOne is now AT&T Broadband. dhcpcd works with it.
	Makefile.am:
	- Copy the binary dhcpcd to the distribution. Added a comment about
	  the dist-hook target.
	configure.in:
	- Remove AC_CANONICAL_TARGET - dhcpcd is not a compiler.
	- Don't check Linux version - it can be determined at the compile time.
	- Don't call uname directly - rely on the results of
	  AC_CANONICAL_HOST instead.
	- Don't ever ignore predefined CFLAGS.
	client.c:
	- Include <linux/version.h>
	- Define OLD_LINUX_VERSION for kernels older than 2.1.1.

	The patch is also available here:
	http://www.red-bean.com/~proski/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-pl4.diff

12/19/00 - v.1.3.19-pl4
        Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
	submitted patch to work around broken version of automake
	which was used in generating v.1.3.19-pl3. Also
	dhcpcd-1.3.19-pl4.tar.gz has been generated using
	"make distcheck"

12/15/00 - v.1.3.19-pl3
        Nico Baggus <nico_baggus@compuserve.com>
	- added version checking to the cache file
        - added support for specifying window size for the
	  gateway routes (default = 32768) (gives better throughput
	  when used for Cablenetworks...;-)
	- modified defining the offsets in the ipudphdr & ipicmphdr
	  to get the stuff through gcc 2.96

	Pavel Roskin <proski@gnu.org>
	Makefile.am:
	  - Manuals and examples added to EXTRA_DIST
	  - dhcpcd.spec added to the distribution.
	  - dhcpcd.spec is now rebuilt by "make all".
	  - "make rpm" depends on "make distcheck" and uses the dhcpcd.conf
	     embedded into the tarball.
	config.guess:
	  - Updated to the latest version. PA-Linux team will appreciate it.
	config.sub:
	  - Likewise.
	configure.in:
	  - Versioning simplified to ensure the right tarball name.
	    Removed dash from the patchlevel to accomodate rpm.
	  - Avoid square brackets or quote them properly.
	dhcpcd.spec.in:
	  - Substitute "Source".
	  - "BuildRoot" should be under /var/tmp, not /usr/tmp.
	  - Don't use filelists - it breaks with rpm-3.0.5 that compresses
	    manuals.
	  - Include directory /etc/dhcpc.
	  - Exclude dhcpcd.spec.in from docs.
	  - Include any *.lsm file.
	missing:
	  - Updated to avoid problems with future versions of automake.

10/11/00 - v.1.3.19-pl2
	Nils Ohlmeier <nils.ohlmeier@innominate.de> and
	Warren Jones <wjones@tc.fluke.com> rightfully pointed out
	nisDomainName should not be used in resolv.conf file.
	Fixed.

08/05/00 - v.1.3.19-pl1
	Simon Byrnand <sbyrnand@xtra.co.nz> submitted patches to make
	ioctl(dhcpSocket,SIOCSIFADDR,&ifr) call in dhcpStop() routine
	applicable only to kernels versions > 2.0 and
	to fix handling of SIGCHLD signal.

08/05/00 - v.1.3.19-pl0
	Lenz Grimmer <grimmer@suse.de> submitted patch to prevent
	"unaligned memory access" warnings to appear on IA64-based systems.

08/05/00 - v.1.3.18-pl9
	uncommented ioctl(dhcpSocket,SIOCSIFADDR,&ifr) call in dhcpStop()
	routine to prevent interface from having invalid IP address
	during DHCP negotiation.

	Simon Byrnand <sbyrnand@xtra.co.nz> submitted patch to take
	care of the following:
	  o Make dhcpcd both libc5 and glibc compatible
	  o Rebind dhcpSocket after change in IP address to avoid
	    problem with 2.0 kernel losing socket binding to the interface
	    after resetting of the interface
	  o Problem with lost DhcpRelease message under 2.0 kernel
	    when interface gets shut down

	Brian K. White <linut@squonk.net> submitted "Note 4." to the
	README file.

05/10/00 - v.1.3.18-pl8
	Konstantin Boldyshev <konst@linuxassembly.org> submitted patch
	to make dhcpcd work with 2.0 kernels. Modified configure script
	to pass -DOLD_LINUX_VERSION flag to compiler if the kernel version
	is 2.0.xx, in which case socket(AF_INET,SOCK_PACKET,..) call is used
	instead of socket(AF_PACKET,SOCK_PACKET,..) and the local route
	is added. Local route is added automatically under more recent kernels.

	Rolf Jentsch <RJentsch@electronicpartner.de> submitted patch to
	add -T flag to the dhcpcd command line. With -T flag dhcpcd will
	go through normal DHCP negotiation sequence but will not configure
	the interface or otherwise change anything on the system. Useful for
	testing DHCP servers. 

05/06/00 - v.1.3.18-pl7
	Simon Baatz <baatz@informatik.uni-bonn.de> submited patch to fix
	possible problem in retransmitting DHCP requests, and make dhcpcd
	adapt to possible change in DHCP server address in the middle of a
	client's lease.

	Habibie <habibie@MailandNews.com> submitted patch to include
	GNU automake, autoconf, and RPM packaging features into dhcpcd
	distribution. Now dhcpcd build follows usual GNU scheme:

	./configure
	make

	In any case, the old Makefile is also included. ./configure overwrites
	it with generated version.

	Added "-n" flag to dhcpcd command line. Now "dhcpcd -n" will force
	currently running dhcpcd to try to renew the lease. This behavior
	is similar to "pump -R".

04/15/00 - v.1.3.18-pl6
	Jarno Huuskonen <jhuuskon@messi.uku.fi> submited patch to set
	dhcpcd's process umask to 022 before creating /etc/resolv.conf file.

	Scott Bronson <bronson@trestle.com> sent some feedback on how RH "pump"
	behaves vs. dhcpcd. Now dhcpcd will also send second DHCP_DISCOVER
	message.

	Performing checksum on received packets is now optional and can be
	switched on with -C option on dhcpcd command line.

03/27/00 - v.1.3.18-pl5
	Lenz Grimmer <grimmer@suse.de> sent a patch to make dhcpcd do
	reverse hostname lookup in a case DHCP server did not provide
	hostName option with -H flag or in a case DHCP server did not provide
	domainName option with -D flag to dhcpcd.
	A bit enhanced version of the patch moved into "production".

03/27/00 - v.1.3.18-pl4
	Removed "-m586" from Makefile.
	The static executable contained with the distribution has been compiled
	against glibc-2.1.3 and 2.3.99-pre3 kernel. 

10/27/99 - v.1.3.18-pl3
	Mike Hartman <wild@klondike.com> pointed out to include
	NULL byte at the end of the HostName string.

10/26/99 - v.1.3.18-pl2
	Mike Hartman <wild@klondike.com> submited a patch to fix
	a bug in handling "-h" flag. Hostname option flag has been broken
	since v.1.3.18-pl0.

09/17/99 - v.1.3.18-pl1
	Put back "1.3.17-pl10" patch with some tweaking to get rid
	of error in recvfrom call. Some minor cleanup.

09/01/99 - v.1.3.18-pl0
        Reversed 1.3.17-pl10 patch. Binding dhcpSocket to the
	interface produced error in recvfrom() call.
	Chris G. Demetriou <cgd@netbsd.org> sent a patch
	to make dhcpcd code portable to ARM platform.
	Added "-s [ipaddr]" command-line option which makes dhcpcd
	send DHCP_INFORM message. Added "-B" command-line option
	to make dhcpcd solicit broadcast response. Added LOG_CONS option to
	openlog(3). Changed "domain xxx" entry in resolv.conf to point
	by default to nisDomainName, added "search nisDomainName" and
	"search domainName" entries to resolv.conf file.
	dhcpcd-<interface>.info file has minor changes to the format.
	Namely, DNS and GATEWAY entries now will provide a comma-separated
	list of corresponding IP addresses, not just the first IP address in
	the list. Added support for static route option.

07/23/99 - v.1.3.17-pl10.
	Johan Verrept <Johan.Verrept@alcatel.be> suggested "bind"-ing
	dhcpSocket to the interface so the socket does not
	receive packets from other interfaces. Change made to dhcpStart
	routine to include a call to the bind().

07/09/99 - v.1.3.17-pl9.
	PETAZZONI <jpetazzo@ryu.univ-mlv.fr> reported a case of
	DHCP server responding with IpAddrLeaseTime=0 which
	drove dhcpcd-1.3 mad. Added check for IpAddrLeaseTime=0 so
	when dhcpcd receives IpAddrLeasetime=0 it will assume
	DEFAULT_LEASETIME, infinite by default.
	Added '-V' flag to dhcpcd syntax. Dhcpcd will print
	copyright/version banner when used with '-V' flag.

06/19/99 - v.1.3.17-pl8.
	Olivier Baudron <Olivier.Baudron@ens.fr> pointed out
	to a problem with in_cksum routine when compiling with
	egcs or gcc-2.8.xx compilers and proposed a patch to
	work around the compiler bug.
	Changed in_cksum routine in udpipgen.c file to
	get rid of problems with wrong checksums if compiled
	with egcs or gcc-2.8.xx compilers.

06/10/99 - v.1.3.17-pl7.
	Hans Andersson <Hans.XH.Andersson@trab.se> and some
	other gentlemen pointed out at 64-bit uncleanless of
	current dhcpcd code, and sent relevant patches.
	This release is an attempt to make dhcpcd-1.3
	64-bit safe. No new functionality has been added.
	This is left for v.1.3.18.

05/10/99 - v.1.3.17-pl6.
	Andrew S. Howell <andy@tibco.com> submitted a patch
	eliminating unnecessary padOptions in buildmsg.c file.
	It helped with his cable modem. Removed
	"Your IP address=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" message on a screen
	when dhcpcd configures the interface.

03/14/99 - v.1.3.17-pl5.
	Mike Benoit <ipso@academyoflearning.ca> submitted
	debugging info. Change made to "client.c" to allow
	dhcpcd to get router IP address from DHCP_ACK message
	if it didn't come with DHCP_OFFER. 

03/10/99 - v.1.3.17-pl4.
	Tim Auckland <tim.auckland@Corp.Sun.COM> submitted
	patch to dhcpcd-1.3.17-pl3 to close all standard
	file descriptors when dhcpcd forks into background.
	It should help with pcmcia cards which use popen() call.

02/04/99 - v.1.3.17-pl3.
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Now if dhcpcd does not get DHCP_ACK for the same
	IP address as before reboot, it will fall back
	to dhcpInit and will send DHCP_DISCOVER message(s).
	Dhcpcd will now write pid file before forking
	into background not after. Updated manual page.

01/15/99 - v.1.3.17-pl2.
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Changed the dhcpcd exec-bin directory from /usr/sbin to /sbin.
	Pavel Polischouk <pavelp@iil.intel.com> sent a tcpdump
	which inspired me to make some changes to the code
	to avoid potential race condition when there are multiple
	DHCP servers on the network.

01/12/99 - v.1.3.17-pl1.
	Marc ZYNGIER <Marc.Zyngier@wanadoo.fr> submitted another
	patch to dhcpcd-1.3 to make it work on Linux Alpha
	platforms.

01/10/99 - v.1.3.17
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Came across patch for dhcpcd-1.3.16
	submitted to linux.debian.alpha
	by Marc Zyngier Marc.Zyngier@bull.net.
	Changed the default lease time requested
	to infinite.
	Removed "mlip" client 'cause of www.ml.org death.
	Did some other minor changes to the code.

11/09/98 - v.1.3.16
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Thanks to a great help from Brion Vibber <brion@pobox.com>
	another nasty bug has been found and hopefully
	squashed. Also the problem with setting default
	route on some of the systems has been finally
	solved. Kernel refuses to accept a route for a gateway
	if its IP address does not seem to be on the same
	subnet as in a case with bridged subnets.
	The work around suggested by Brion Vibber is
	to add a local route to the gateway. I hope we've got
	it right in v.1.3.16.

11/07/98 - v.1.3.15
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Fixed rather nasty bug in dhcpSendAndRecv routine
	introduced in v.1.3.13 which might have prevented
	quite of few users from receiving DHCP_OFFER message.
	Added command-line options -D,-H,-R to dhcpcd.
	Request and patch submitted by Aron Griffis <agriffis@css.tayloru.edu>

10/28/98 - v.1.3.14
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Removed setting a local route in addition to default one
	in v.1.3.13. This did not help with the problem
	one user experiences with setting a default route but
	rather resulted in duplicate entries for the local
	route in the routing table.

10/27/98 - v.1.3.13
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Fixed a minor bug in dhcpSendAndRecv routine
	which caused quite a few bogus "DHCP server declined request: op=XX"
	messages in /var/log/debug file.
	Add (or rather put back) setting of local route.
	Normally the local route is set automatically by
	the kernel when default route entry is added, however
	as it seems that doesn't always work for everybody.

10/25/98 - v.1.3.12
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Made a good faith attempt to squash a bug in UDP/IP
	layer of dhcpcd which might have been a cause of
	problems on PPC-based systems. Originally reported
	by Martin Costabel <martin@wanadoo.fr>.
	Rewrote quite a bit of UDP/IP code so if dhcpcd-1.3.12
	doesn't work for you at all you may try v.1.3.11.
	There seemed to be a problem with setting default
	route on 2.1.125 kernel reported by Brion Vibber
	<brion@pobox.com>. Changed "dhcpConfig" to not force
	dhcpcd to die if it cannot set default route. At least
	it would be easier to find the cause of problem...
	Also did some changes to "client.c" code to move it
	closer to the point when one can add support for Token Ring
	and/or other link protocols.

10/15/98 - v.1.3.11
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Put back '-c filename' option for dhcpcd due to
	a requests from some users of Mediaone cable modems
	who were trying to use 'ipup' et similar bootup scripts.
	Originally requested by Robert Shapiro <rshapiro@mediaone.com>
	Some minor fixes.

10/13/98 - v.1.3.10
        Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
        Added a new feature: whenever the assigned IP address for the
	interface changes dhcpcd will execute /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-interface.exe
        program. The word <interface> is substituted by
	the actual interface name like e.g. eth0.
	Caution: do not use /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-interface.exe as a bootup
	script. It will not be executed if the assigned IP address
	is the same as it was before reboot.
        The included sample /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-interface.exe will log
	the time of IP change to /var/log/messages file.
	The included mlip program changes the IP address 
	for your host at DNS servers provided by www.ml.org
	in a case you happen to be a member of Monolith's DynDNS.
        Edit mlip.h file to supply your hostname, username, and password at
	Monolith. Do "make mlip" to compile it. Then copy the executable
	to /etc/dhcpc/dhcpcd-interface.exe.

	Added a compile time options '-DSETHOSTNAME' and '-DSETDOMAINNAME'
	to Makefile. If used, dhcpcd will set hostname and/or domainname
	of the host to the values it receives from DHCP server.

	Rehashed the Changes file to reverse the time order of entries.

10/02/98 - v.1.3.9
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Reduced the timeouts for sending and receiving DHCP messages.
	Commented out arpCheck() call. It didn't work anyway
	because there won't be ARP_REPLY message unless the
	sender's IP address is set which defeats the purpose
	of doing ARP check. This is something for the authors
        of RFC 2131 to fix.

09/04/98 - v.1.3.8
        Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
	Some user reported he couldn't get dhcpcd to configure
	interface because it failed to set broadcast address.
	Changed the order dhcpcd configures the interface so it does
	1. sets IP address
	2. sets netmask
	3. sets broadcast address (redundant?)
	Reduced the timeout for ARP check from 10secs to 3 secs, so
	dhcpcd finishes faster.

08/01/98 -
        Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com>
        Changed the "time since bootup" parameter in DHCP_DISCOVER
	message from zero to 5 secs to accomodate for WinNT DHCP server
	wishes. General cleanup.
	
01/31/98 -
	Sergei Viznyuk <sv@phystech.com> :
	Changed dhcpcd to use socket(AF_PACKET,SOCK_PACKET,..)
	instead of socket(AF_INET,SOCK_DGRAM,..) which did not
	work with newer kernels.
	Dropped 'dhcpcd -c filename' usage in favor of dhcpcd
	returning valid exit status to the parent.
	Added '-t timeout' option which specifies for how
	long 'dhcpcd' will try to get an IP address before
	forking into background.
	Changed 'dhcpcd -d' option to be a debug flag.


========  before v.1.3 ============

08/28/97    1. added '-I' (client identifier) option.
  0.70      2. added '-h' (hostname) option (Note 10).

04/24/97   changed the source UDP port from a random number to 68
  0.65     because some servers respond to NOT port 68 but the source
           UDP port in the received datagram (Note 9).

03/16/97   1. fixed the bug that DHCPDECLINE message was RFC1541
  0.6         compliant. Now dhcpcd can send both Interned Draft
              compliant DHCPDECLINE message and RFC1541 compliant
              one (mkDhcpDeclineMsg).
           2. fixed the bug that the broadcast address and the
              subnetmask were set to the wrong value under the
              following condition:
                1. dhcpcd is in the REBOOTING state
                2. received DHCP ACK msg does not include the
                   broadcast or subnetmask option.
              (rebooting in client.c)
           3. fixed the bug that dhcpcd does not send a DHCPDECLINE
              msg when it detects the duplicate IP adddress
              (arpCheck in arp.c)..
           4. changed the way to make a DHCPREQUEST msg in the
              SELECTING state (selecting, mkDhcpRequestMsg)
           5. changed the pcmcia/network script to unmount the NFS
              filesystems before invoking "dhcpcd -k" command when
              the card service goes down.
           6. added a new environment variable DHCP_DEVICE, which
              contains the name of network interface to which
              dhcpcd is attached.

03/07/97   1. fixed the bug that the renewal time and the rebind time
              are messed up (becomes minus number :p) when dhcpcd gets
              the lease time whose least significant byte is greater
              than or equal to 0x80 (setDhcpInfo in client.c) (Note 7).
              For example, if the lease time is 24 hours, dhcpcd does
              not work.
           2. added the hostname option to the parameter request list
              (mkDhcpDiscoverMsg and mkDhcpRequestMsg in client.c)
           3. fixed the bug that dhcpcd sends a DHCPREQUEST message
              which does not have the server identifier option in the
              SELECTING state (mkDhcpRequestMsg in client.c)
           4. fixed the bug that dhcpcd uses the information from the
              DHCPOFFER message for configuring the host (it must use
              the information from the DHCPREQUEST message) (initHost
              in client.c) (Note 8).

01/30/97   made version 0.5a2 into 0.5, and released it.
  0.5

01/20/97   changed init, renewing, rebinding (client.c), and
  0.5a2    rcvAndCheckDhcpMsg (socket-if.c) to fix the bug that dhcpcd
           exited with holding the assigned IP address when it failed in
           invoking sendto system call in the RENEWING state. This happened
           when the server is down in the RENEWING state. It causes
           hosts to use expired IP addresses (how dangerous!). Now
           dhcpcd does not exit even when it gets an error from sendto
           in the RENEWING state. It continues to use the assigned IP
           address until the lease time is expired, then it
           initializes the network interface and goes into the INIT
           state (Note 6).

01/13/97   1. added IFF_MULTICAST in initHost (client.c) (Note 1).
  0.5a     2. fixed the bug that dhcpcd core-dumped when it received a
              datagram containig the DHCP message option (parseDhcpMsg
              in options.c) (Note 2).
           3. added -r option which makes dhcpcd RFC1541 compliant
              (Note 3).
           4. changed mkDhcpRequestMsg (client.c) to put the
              parameter request list option into the DHCPREQUEST
              message in order to support the CMU version of DHCP
              server (Note 4). But I do not check whether it works
              with the CMU version of DHCP server.
           5. changed the argument to logOpen from LOG_CONS to LOG_PID
              (Note 5).
           6. add nextState initialization in rebinding (client.c).
           7. changed the host information file name from "hostinfo"
              to "hostinfo-ifname" (saveHostInfo in hostinfo.c)
              (Note 5). Ifname is actually replaced with the network
              interface name like "eth0". This is good when multiple
              dhcpcd's attach to different network interfaces.

09/22/96   made dhcpcd compliant to the Internet Draft in order to
  0.4      work with ISC version of DHCP server.
           Changed client.c, options.c, socket-if.c

09/19/96   quick fix to make it work with ISC's dhcpd. I made BROACAST
  0.33     flag available and added the NEED_BCAST_RESPONSE macro.
           ISC's DHCP server is the Internet Draft compliant, but
           dhcpcd is RFC1541 compliant. So this is a "workaround" version.

09/17/96   added the code checking option field to parseDhcpMsg (options.c)
  0.32

09/16/96   fixed a typo in selecting (client.c)
  0.31

09/13/96   1. enhanced NTP support. Now dhcpcd creates the file, ntp.conf
  0.3         in the directory, /etc/dhcpc.
           2. added the code verifying if router addresses are correct

09/12/96   added the following sample shell scripts:
  0.3b       1. "network" for pcmcia-cs
             2. "rc" scripts (rc.inet1, rc.inet2, rc.M)
             3. "rc.dhcp", a command file which can be executed from dhcpcd

09/11/96   1. fixed a bug in setDefRoute (if.c). rt_flags was RT_UP.
  0.3a        It should be RT_GATEWAY.
           2. fixed typos in openRecvSocket (socket-if.c)
           3. changed the way to invoke a command file from using
              signal to forking twice
           4. removed unnecessary socket close/re-open

09/09/96   added support to the "router" option.
  0.25a     changed files: options.c, dhcp-options.h, dhcp.h, hostinfo.c,
                           if.c, client.c

08/09/96   added the code to make a copy of the DHCP options in the
  0.2      DHCPOFFER message because Windows NT server does not put
           DHCP options in the DHCPACK message except for netmask, T1
           time, and T2time. Other DHCP options are only in the
           DHCPOFFER message.

07/27/96    added '-i' option specifying the class identifier because
  0.2a      RFC1541 says "The client implementation of DHCP should
            provide a mechanism for the user to select directly the
            'class-identifier' value.".

07/23/96    1. moved ARP check from just after dhcpcd received a
  0.2a         DHCPOFFER message to just after dhcpcd received a
               DHCPACK message.
            2. added 'Parameter Request List' in the DHCPDISCOVER message.
            3. added code to output the content of DHCP message option from
               the server

Note  1: Koji Okamura suggested this.
Note  2: This fix was made by Dan Halbert.
Note  3: Dan Halbert found that dhcpcd-0.4 does not work with some
         RFC1541 compliant DHCP servers, and made a patch for it.
         Brandon Mitchell suggested -r option.
Note  4: N. Komazaki found that CMU's DHCP server (dhcpd-3.3.7
          +patch) requires the parameter request option in the
         DHCPREQUEST message.
Note  5: Ulrich Windl suggested this.
Note  6: Koji Okamura found this bug.
Note  7: Andrew Kieschnick found this bug.
Note  8: Tim Riker found this bug.
Note  9: I found this problem by using the tcpdump log which
         Larry Hawkins sent me.
Note 10: I found some DHCP servers require this option by using the
         tcpdump log which David Filiatrault sent me.
