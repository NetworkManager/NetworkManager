# An example that creates a NMClient instance for another GMainContext
# and iterates the context while doing an async D-Bus call.
#
# D-Bus is fundamentally async. libnm's NMClient API caches D-Bus objects
# on NetworkManager's D-Bus API. As such, it is "frozen" (with the current
# content of the cache) while not iterating the GMainContext. Only by iterating
# the GMainContext any events are processed and things change.
#
# This means, NMClient heavily uses GMainContext (and GDBusConnection)
# and to operate it, you need to iterate the GMainContext. The synchronous
# API (like NM.Client.new()) is for simple programs but usually not best
# for using NMClient for real applications.
#
# To learn more about GMainContext, read https://developer.gnome.org/SearchProvider/documentation/tutorials/main-contexts.html
# When I say "mainloop" or "event loop", I mean GMainContext. GMainLoop is
# a small wrapper around GMainContext to run the context with a boolean
# flag.
#
# Usually, non trivial applications run the GMainContext (or GMainLoop)
# from the main() function and aside some setup and teardown, everything
# happens as events from the event loop.
# This example instead performs synchronous steps, and at the places where
# we need to get the result of some async operation, we iterate the GMainContext
# until we get the result. This may not be how a complex application works,
# but you might do this on a simpler application (like a script) that iterates
# the mainloop whenever it needs to wait for async operations to complete.
#
# Iterating the mainloop might dispatch any other sources that are ready.
# In this example nobody else is scheduling unrelated timers or events, but
# if that happens, your application needs to cope with that.
# E.g. while iterating the mainloop many times, still don't nest running the
# same main context (unless you really know what you do).
