 *   etc.
 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_DISCONNECTED: the device can be activated, but is currently
 *   idle and not connected to a network.
 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_PREPARE: the device is preparing the connection to the
 *   network.  This may include operations like changing the MAC address,
 *   setting physical link properties, and anything else required to connect
 *   to the requested network.
 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_CONFIG: the device is connecting to the requested network.
 *   This may include operations like associating with the WiFi AP, dialing

 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_IP_CONFIG: the device is requesting IPv4 and/or IPv6
 *   addresses and routing information from the network.
 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_IP_CHECK: the device is checking whether further action is
 *   required for the requested network connection.  This may include checking
 *   whether only local network access is available, whether a captive portal
 *   is blocking access to the Internet, etc.
 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_SECONDARIES: the device is waiting for a secondary
 *   connection (like a VPN) which must activated before the device can be
 *   activated
 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVATED: the device has a network connection, either local
 *   or global.
 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_DEACTIVATING: a disconnection from the current network
 *   connection was requested, and the device is cleaning up resources used for
 *   that connection.  The network connection may still be valid.
 * @NM_DEVICE_STATE_FAILED: the device failed to connect to the requested
 *   network and is cleaning up the connection request

 *   If the connection was previously persistent, the corresponding file on disk
 *   is not deleted but merely the connection is decoupled from the file
 *   on disk. If you later delete an in-memory connection, the connection
 *   on disk will be deleted as well.
 * @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY_DETACHED: this is like @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY,
 *   but if the connection has a corresponding file on disk, the association between
 *   the connection and the file is forgotten but the file is not modified.
 *   The difference to %NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY is if you later
 *   save the connection again to disk, a new file name will be chosen without
 *   overwriting the remaining file on disk. Also, if you delete the connection
 *   later, the file on disk will not be deleted.
 * @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY_ONLY: this is like @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY,
 *   but if the connection has a corresponding file on disk, the file on
 *   disk will be deleted.
 * @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_VOLATILE: This can be specified with either
 *   %NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY_DETACHED or %NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY_ONLY.
 *   After making the connection in-memory only, the connection is marked
 *   as volatile. That means, if the connection is currently not active
 *   it will be deleted right away. Otherwise, it is marked to for deletion
 *   once the connection deactivates. A volatile connection cannot autoactivate
 *   again (because it's about to be deleted), but a manual activation will
 *   clear the volatile flag.
 * @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_BLOCK_AUTOCONNECT: usually, when the connection
 *   has autoconnect enabled and is modified, it becomes elegible to autoconnect
 *   right away. Setting this flag, disables autoconnect until the connection
 *   is manually activated.
