/*
 * RB-Tree Implementation
 * This implements the insertion/removal of elements in RB-Trees. You're highly
 * recommended to have an RB-Tree documentation at hand when reading this. Both
 * insertion and removal can be split into a handful of situations that can
 * occur. Those situations are enumerated as "Case 1" to "Case n" here, and
 * follow closely the cases described in most RB-Tree documentations. This file
 * does not explain why it is enough to handle just those cases, nor does it
 * provide a proof of correctness. Dig out your algorithm 101 handbook if
 * you're interested.
 *
 * This implementation is *not* straightforward. Usually, a handful of
 * rotation, reparent, swap and link helpers can be used to implement the
 * rebalance operations. However, those often perform unnecessary writes.
 * Therefore, this implementation hard-codes all the operations. You're highly
 * recommended to look at the two basic helpers before reading the code:
 *     c_rbnode_swap_child()
 *     c_rbnode_set_parent_and_flags()
 * Those are the only helpers used, hence, you should really know what they do
 * before digging into the code.
 *
 * For a highlevel documentation of the API, see the header file and docbook
 * comments.
