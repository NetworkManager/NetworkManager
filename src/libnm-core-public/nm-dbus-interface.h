 * NMMetered:
 * @NM_METERED_UNKNOWN:     The metered status is unknown

 * @NM_METERED_NO:          Not metered, the value was explicitly configured
 * @NM_METERED_GUESS_YES:   Metered, the value was guessed
 * @NM_METERED_GUESS_NO:    Not metered, the value was guessed
 *
 * The NMMetered enum has two different purposes: one is to configure
 * "connection.metered" setting of a connection profile in #NMSettingConnection, and
 * the other is to express the actual metered state of the #NMDevice at a given moment.
 *
 * For the connection profile only #NM_METERED_UNKNOWN, #NM_METERED_NO
 * and #NM_METERED_YES are allowed.
 *
 * The device's metered state at runtime is determined by the profile
 * which is currently active. If the profile explicitly specifies #NM_METERED_NO
 * or #NM_METERED_YES, then the device's metered state is as such.
 * If the connection profile leaves it undecided at #NM_METERED_UNKNOWN (the default),
 * then NetworkManager tries to guess the metered state, for example based on the
 * device type or on DHCP options (like Android devices exposing a "ANDROID_METERED"
 * DHCP vendor option). This then leads to either #NM_METERED_GUESS_NO or #NM_METERED_GUESS_YES.
 *
 * Most applications probably should treat the runtime state #NM_METERED_GUESS_YES
 * like #NM_METERED_YES, and all other states as not metered.
 *
 * Note that the per-device metered states are then combined to a global metered
 * state. This is basically the metered state of the device with the best default
 * route. However, that generalization of a global metered state may not be correct
 * if the default routes for IPv4 and IPv6 are on different devices, or if policy
 * routing is configured. In general, the global metered state tries to express whether
 * the traffic is likely metered, but since that depends on the traffic itself,
 * there is not one answer in all cases. Hence, an application may want to consider
 * the per-device's metered states.

 *   Likewise, when finally deleting the profile, both the storage from /run
 *   and persistent storage are deleted (or if the persistent storage does not
 *   allow deletion, and nmmeta file is written to mark the UUID as deleted).
 * @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY_DETACHED: this is almost the same
 *   as %NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY, with one difference: when later deleting
 *   the profile, the original profile will not be deleted. Instead a nmmeta
 *   file is written to /run to indicate that the profile is gone.
 *   Note that if such a nmmeta tombstone file exists and hides a file in persistent
 *   storage, then when re-adding the profile with the same UUID, then the original
 *   storage is taken over again.
 * @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY_ONLY: this is like %NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY,
 *   but if the connection has a corresponding file on persistent storage, the file
 *   will be deleted right away. If the profile is later again persisted to disk,
 *   a new, unused filename will be chosen.

 *   %NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY, %NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY_DETACHED
 *   or %NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_IN_MEMORY_ONLY.
 *   After making the connection in-memory only, the connection is marked
 *   as volatile. That means, if the connection is currently not active
 *   it will be deleted right away. Otherwise, it is marked to for deletion
 *   once the connection deactivates. A volatile connection cannot autoactivate
 *   again (because it's about to be deleted), but a manual activation will
 *   clear the volatile flag.
 * @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_BLOCK_AUTOCONNECT: usually, when the connection
 *   has autoconnect enabled and is modified, it becomes eligible to autoconnect
 *   right away. Setting this flag, disables autoconnect until the connection
 *   is manually activated.
 * @NM_SETTINGS_UPDATE2_FLAG_NO_REAPPLY: when a profile gets modified that is
 *   currently active, then these changes don't take effect for the active
 *   device unless the profile gets reactivated or the configuration reapplied.
 *   There are two exceptions: by default "connection.zone" and "connection.metered"

 *   the profile. Since: 1.20.
