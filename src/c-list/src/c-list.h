/*
 * Circular Intrusive Double Linked List Collection in ISO-C11
 *
 * This implements a generic circular double linked list. List entries must
 * embed the CList object, which provides pointers to the next and previous
 * element. Insertion and removal can be done in O(1) due to the double links.
 * Furthermore, the list is circular, thus allows access to front/tail in O(1)
 * as well, even if you only have a single head pointer (which is not how the
 * list is usually operated, though).
 *
 * Note that you are free to use the list implementation without a head
 * pointer. However, usual operation uses a single CList object as head, which
 * is itself linked in the list and as such must be identified as list head.
 * This allows very simply list operations and avoids a lot of special cases.
 * Most importantly, you can unlink entries without requiring a head pointer.

/**
 * c_list_for_each*() - iterators
 *
 * The c_list_for_each*() macros provide simple for-loop wrappers to iterate
 * a linked list. They come in a set of flavours:
 *
 *   - "entry": This combines c_list_entry() with the loop iterator, so the
 *              iterator always has the type of the surrounding object, rather
 *              than CList.
 *
 *   - "safe": The loop iterator always keeps track of the next element to
 *             visit. This means, you can safely modify the current element,
 *             while retaining loop-integrity.
 *             You still must not touch any other entry of the list. Otherwise,
 *             the loop-iterator will be corrupted.
 *
 *   - "continue": Rather than starting the iteration at the front of the list,
 *                 use the current value of the iterator as starting position.
 *                 Note that the first loop iteration will be the following
 *                 element, not the given element.
 *
 *   - "unlink": This unlinks the current element from the list before the loop
 *               code is run. Note that this only does a partial unlink, since
 *               it assumes the entire list will be unlinked. You must not
 *               break out of the loop, or the list will be in an inconsistent
 *               state.
