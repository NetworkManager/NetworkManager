# A list of packages useful/needed to build and develop
# NetworkManager on Fedora and RHEL.

# Not all of these packages are available, depending
# on your distribution/release. But yum will happily
# skip them.
#
# Not all of these packages are strictly speaking necessary.
# This is a generous list of related packages.
