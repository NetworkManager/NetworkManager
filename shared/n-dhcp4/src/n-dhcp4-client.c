 * * N_DHCP4_CLIENT_EVENT_GRANTED:   A selected lease was granted by the server.

 * * N_DHCP4_CLIENT_EVENT_RETRACTED: A selected lease offer was retracted by the
 *                                   server. This can happen in case the server
 *                                   offers the same lease to several clients,

 *                                   in the lease is already in use.
 * * N_DHCP4_CLIENT_EVENT_EXTENDED:  An active lease is extended, if applicable
 *                                   the kernel should be updated with the new
 *                                   lifetime information for addresses and/or
 *                                   routes.
 * * N_DHCP4_CLIENT_EVENT_EXPIRED:   An active lease failed to be extended by
 *                                   the end of its lifetime. The client should
 *                                   immediately stop using the information
 *                                   contained in the lease.
 * * N_DHCP4_CLIENT_EVENT_DOWN:      The network interface was put down down.
 *                                   The user is recommended to reestablish the

 *                                   purely informational, the probe will keep
 *                                   running, and if the network topology does
 *                                   not change any lease we have will still be
 *                                   valid.
 * * N_DHCP4_CLIENT_EVENT_CANCELLED: The probe was cancelled. This can happen if
 *                                   the client attempted several incompatible

 * @client:                     client to operate on
 * @mtu:                        new mtu
 *
 * This updates the link MTU used by the client object. By default, the minimum
 * requirement given by the IP specification is assumed, which means 576
 * bytes. The caller is advised to update this to the actual MTU used by the
 * link layer.
 *
 * This value reflects the MTU of the link layer. That is, it is the maximum
 * packet size that you can send on that link, excluding the link-header but
 * including the IP-header. On ethernet-v2 this would be 1500.
 *
 * If unsure, it is safe to leave this unset. However, in this case a DHCP
 * server will be required to omit information if it does not fit into the
 * default MTU.
 *
 * Unless you keep the default MTU, you should update the MTU whenever the link
 * MTU changes. That is, when it is increased *and* when it is decreased.
 * However, you must be aware that decreasing the MTU on a link might cause
 * temporary data loss.
 *
 * Background: Knowing the link MTU guarantees that we can possibly transmit
 *             packets bigger than the IP minimum (i.e., 576 bytes). However,
 *             it does not guarantee that a possible target supports parsing
 *             packets bigger than the IP minimum. Hence, the MTU is used by a
 *             client to send a hint to a server that it can receive replies
 *             bigger than the minimum. As such, a server can reply with more
 *             information than otherwise possible.
 *             Since this DHCP client does not support fragmented packets, we
 *             simply set the allowed packet-size to the local link MTU.
 *             Note that DHCP relays might cause DHCP packets to be routed.
 *             However, such relays are required to always reassemble any
 *             fragments they receive into full DHCP packets, before they
 *             forward them either way. This guarantees that incoming packets
 *             are never fragmented, unless they exceed the local link MTU
 *             (this would otherwise not neccessarily be true, if some other
 *             part of the routed network had a lower MTU).
 *
 * Return: 0 on success, negative error code on failure.
