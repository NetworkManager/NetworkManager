# n-dhcp4 - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4

## CHANGES WITH 1:

        * Initial release of n-dhcp4, an implementation of the IPv4 Dynamic
          Host Configuration Protocol as defined in RFC-2132+.

        * This is a pre-release. The code is not yet ready for production.
          Furthermore, the server implementation is incomplete and subject to
          change.
          The client implementation is considered complete, but the API is not
          set in stone. We will have to adapt it according to the needs of the
          users. Hence, this release does not provide any ABI stability
          guarantees, yet.

        * The n-dhcp4 project is now dual-licensed: ASL-2.0 and LGPL-2.1+
