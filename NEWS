=============================================
NetworkManager-1.12
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-1.10
=============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* Improved support for configuration checkpoint, including support in libnm.
* Added capability to set IP Tunnel configuration flags.
* The systemd-resolved DNS plugins now supports MDNS.
* systemd-resolved and dnsmasq DNS plugins now honor the DNS priority setting.
* Wi-Fi devices now support FILS for speedier roaming support.
* Drop dependency on libnl3 library.
* Add support for "onlink" routes.
* More robust connectivity checking.
* Dropped the obsolete "ifnet" settings plugin,

  concise output.
* Reworked the inner workings of D-Bus interface for better resource efficiency.
* Add support for configuring nmcli coloring via terminal-colors.d(5).
* Added experimental support for Meson build system,
* Added initial IWD Wi-Fi daemon support.
* A non-hexadecimal DHCPv4 client-id is now properly passed to
  dhclient with the first byte (type) set to zero, as stated in the
  documentation. This represents a change in behavior since previous
  versions where the first character of the string was used as
  type. The internal client is not affected by the change.
* DNS setting rc-manager=file now always follows dangling symlinks
  instead of replacing /etc/resolv.conf with a plain file.
* Added wake_on_wlan connection setting to configure
  wake-on-wireless-lan (WoWLAN).
* The libnm-glib library, deprecated in favor of libnm since NetworkManager 1.0,
  is now not built by default. While it can still be enabled, the distributions
  should have a good plan for removing it if they need to keep shipping it at
  this point.
* nmcli now scans for Wi-Fi networks before displaying them, if the last scan
  was too long ago.
* Added the ipv6.dhcp-duid property to allow configuring the DHCPv6 DUID
* Extended ipv6.dhcp-client-id property to support DHCP client identifiers
  depending on the MAC address and the stable ID.
* Set NM_DISPATCHER_ACTION environment variable in dispatcher scripts.

    to be capable of setting up simple OpenVSwitch configurations.
* Added support for activating PPP connections on non-Ethernet
  interfaces.
* It is now possible to authenticate to a Wi-Fi network using WPS
    (Wi-Fi Protected Setup).
* Implemented support for Wi-Fi PMF (Protected Management Frames,

============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* Default routes set by devices that failed connectivity checks are now
    penalized with a higher metric
* nmcli is now able to produce output more friendly for machine parsing
* The slaves available at the time a master connection is activated are
    enslaved in a stable order, making the automatic MAC address for Bonding
    devices more predictable.
* Hostname management is now more flexibly configured
* Support for additional route options (pref-src, src, tos, window, cwnd,
    initcwnd, initrwnd, mtu, lock-window, lock-cwnd, lock-initcwnd, lock-initrwnd,
    and lock-mtu).
* Fixed detection of EAP-FAST support in wpa_supplicant
* Support for handling PINs for PKCS#11 tokens as secrets
* GSM and CDMA connections now have a MTU property
* An option to disable selected TLS versions during EAP phase 1 authentication
* The 802.1x authentication timeout is now configurable to allow a faster
    fallback to other connections
* Persist managed state of device until reboot. This improves seamless take over
    of a previously managed device after restart of NetworkManager.
* Better handle devices that are externally managed by somebody else by
    consistently generating an in-memory connection to reflect the external
    state.
* Expose SRIOV capability of a device on D-Bus and support configuring the
    number of virtual functions via NetworkManager.conf.

    a symlink if it already exists as a regular file.
* Support attaching user-data in form of key-value pairs to connection profiles.
* Fix accpeting fully qualified name for ipv4.dhcp-hostname setting.
* Make NetworkManager more forgiving to failure to change the MAC address during
    scanning.
* Many bug fixes and improvements

============================================
NetworkManager-1.6
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-1.4
============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* Added support for managing the MACsec links. Requires support in
    wpa_supplicant (version newer than 2.6).
* Support for configuration and discovery of Web Proxy settings with
    PacRunner service.
* The ipv6.method=shared is now supported, utilizing DHCPv6 Prefix
    Delegation option to obtain prefixes for the interface.
* Support for systemd-resolved local DNS forwarder backend.
* The configuration is now read from /run/NetworkManager/conf.d as well.
    This is useful for handing over configuration discovered on system
    startup to NetworkManager.
* The PPP manager can now be split into a separate package.
* Added initial support for PKCS#11 tokens with 802.1x authentication.
* Introduced Vala bindings for libnm.
* NetworkManager would now keep most connections up on shutdown (except Wi-Fi
    connections, VPN connections and other kinds that can't be assumed on
    startup)
* The checkpoint/restore connection can now also remove new connections and
    disconnect devices that were activated since the checkpoint was taken.
* New connection.autoconnect_retries property that allows fine-tuning
    the autoconnect behavior.
* Fix emission of NM-style PropertiesChanged signals and deprecate them
    for PropertiesChanged on "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties" interface.
* Change the meaning of unset "cloned-mac-address" settings from "permanent" to
    "preserve". This changes the default value and affects existing connections
    during upgrade that did not explicitly configure cloned-mac-address. This
    has the effect that externally configured MAC addresses are preserved
    by default instead of setting the permanent address (bgo#770611).
* Avoid reading the permanent MAC address before the device is initialized
    by UDEV. This avoids a race where NetworkManager might detect the MAC
    address of the wrong interface.
* The cloned.mac-address property can now be used with Bond and Bridge
    devices.
* The ifcfg parsing code has been reworked for better compatibility with
    actual shell variable files.
* nmtui now supports creating and editing IP tunnel connections.
* The libnm client library now uses the D-Bus ObjectManager API that allows
    for quicker initialization of the clients.
* nmtui now utilizes the asynchronous libnm client API to paralellize
    communication with the daemon, reducing the client startup time.
* Ethernet devices now use "802-3.speed" and "802-3.duplex" properties to
    allow controlling overriding the negotiated link parameters.
* Order in which IP addresses are configured is now preserved so that
    primary address is selected correctly.
* Details of the DNS information obtained from the connections is now
    exposed on the D-Bus and can be inspected with nmcli.
* Fixed race conditions when renaming interfaces, for example as done
    by UDEV for persistent interface naming. This could cause detecting
    devices as the wrong hardware type.
* Added the support for DHCPV6_HOSTNAME and DHCPV6_SEND_HOSTNAME keys in
    ifcfg files that control "dhcp-hostname" and "dhcp-send-hostname"
    properties of the "ipv6" setting.
* The stable-addressing for MAC address randomization and RFC7217 IPv6 stable
    privacy addressing can now be more flexibly configured using dynamic
    randomization seeds in "connection.stable-id".
    See "examples/nm-conf.d/30-anon.conf" for example use.
* When the master of Team, Bridge and Bond devices is specified as a connection
    UUID, the ifcfg-rh plugin now writes the master connection's interface name
    into the ifcfg file for improved compatibility with the legacy network service.
* Improve handling of MTU by resetting the previous MTU when the device deactivates
    and reset the MTU to a defined value on activation.
* Improve tracking of parent devices for dependent devices like ip-tunnels, MACVLAN,
    VETH, VLAN, and VXLAN.
* Many bug fixes and improvements

============================================
NetworkManager-1.4
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-1.2
============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* The MAC address assigned to a device can now be set according to
    different policies: preserve, permanent, random, stable
* NetworkManager now waits for IPv6 DAD to terminate before completing
    the activation
* Added support for setting IPv6 tokenized interface identifiers
    through the 'ipv6.token' connection property
* Added a 'Reload' D-Bus method to reload configuration and reapply
    DNS configuration

    changes after a timeout.
* NetworkManager now follows symlinks when accessing resolv.conf and
    rc-manager is set to 'file'
* Added support for oFono as modem manager
* The devices now exposes counters of transferred data
* The 'may-fail' property of ipv4 and ipv6 settings is now respected
    more accurately
* The timeout for requests of secrets to agents has been increased
    from 25 to 120 seconds
* Name servers passed to dnsmasq now specify an egress interface to
    avoid problems with multiple active connections
* Reverse DNS entries for IPv6 are now added to dnsmasq, and IPv4
    reverse entries now honor the network prefix
* A new 'dns-priority' property of ipv4 and ipv6 settings can be used
    to tweak the order of servers in resolv.conf when multiple
    connections are active
* configure script accepts --enable-{address,undefined}-sanitizer
    options to build NetworkManager with GCC sanitizers
* The default resolv.conf manager can now be specified at build time
    using the --with-config-dns-rc-manager-default configure option
* NetworkManager is now compiled with --gc-sections to reduce
    executable size
* Added a new 'VPN_PLUGIN' logging domain
* It is now possible to change the configuration currently applied on
    a device with 'nmcli device modify' and 'nmcli device reapply'
* nmcli invoked without parameters shows an overview of the current
    network configuration
* The 'nmcli connection add' syntax has been extended and is now
    possible to pass properties (e.g. 'ipv4.dns') along with aliases
* nmtui now returns to initial menu after a sub-form exits
* Improved bash autocompletion for nmcli
* Now devices are disconnected before the system suspends, executing
    dispatcher scripts.  This allows external applications to be notified
    of the change in connectivity
* Dispatcher scripts are now called also when connectivity status
    changes
* Many other fixes and improvements

============================================
NetworkManager-1.2
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-1.0
============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* MAC addresses during Wi-Fi access point scanning are now randomized
    if wpa_supplicant supports PreassocMacAddr.
* Added an option to enable random MAC addresses for association to Wi-Fi access
    point (defaults to disabled).  Controlled with 'wifi.mac-address-randomization'
    property (MAC_ADDRESS_RANDOMIZATION key in ifcfg files).  Requires support from
    wpa_supplicant.
* Wi-Fi scanning now utilizes wpa_supplicant's AP list.
* Added support for Wi-Fi powersave, configured with POWERSAVE key in ifcfg
    files.
* Added support for creation of more types of software devices: tun & tap,
    macvlan, vxlan and ip tunnels (ipip, gre, sit, ip6ip6 and ipip6).
* The software devices (bond, bridge, vlan, team, ...) can now be stacked
    arbitrarily.  The nmcli interface for creating master-slave relationships
    has been significantly improved by the use of 'master' argument to
    all link types.
* RFC7217 stable privacy addressing is now used by default to protect from
    address-based host tracking. The IPv6 addressing mode is configured with
    IPV6_ADDR_GEN_MODE key in ifcfg files.
* Improved route management code to avoid clashes between conflicting
    routes in multiple connections.
* Refactored platform code resulting in more robust interface to platform,
    less overhead and reduced memory footprint.
* Improved interoperability with other network management tools.  The
    externally created software devices are not managed until they're
    activated.
* The Device instances now exist for all software connections and the platform
    devices are now only created when the device is activated.  This makes it
    possible for connections with device of same name not to clash unless
    they're activated concurrently.  The links are now not unnecessarily present
    unless the connection is active, avoiding pollution of the link namespace.
* NetworkManager now correctly manages connectivity in namespace-based
    containers such as LXC and Docker.
* Support for configuring ethernet Wake-On-Lan has been added.
* Added LLDP listener functionality and related CLI client commands. Enabled via
    LLDP option in ifcfg files.
* CLI secret agent has been extended with support for VPN secrets.
* The command line client now utilizes colors for its output.
* The command line client now sorts the devices and properties for better
    clarity.
* Numerous improvements to Bash command completion for nmcli.
* NetworkManager relies on less external libraries.  The use of dbus-glib
    has been replaced with gio's native D-Bus support and libnl-route is no
    longer used.
* Dependency on avahi-autoipd has been dropped.  Native IPv4 link-local
    addressing configuration based on systemd network library is now used
    instead.
* Hostname is now managed via systemd-hostnamed on systemd-based systems.
* Management of resolv.conf can be changed at runtime, private resolv.conf
    is always written in /run.
* NetworkManager can now write DNS options to resolv.conf.
* Added an option to enable the old-fashioned /etc/resolv.conf handling
   (using a symlink)
* Updated version of systemd network library used for internal DHCP and
    IPv4 link-local support.
* Support for event logging via audit subsystem has been added.
* Support for native logging via systemd-journald has been added taking
    advantage of its structured logging.
* Live reconfiguration of IP configuration after changing the settings without
    reactivation of the device with "nmcli device reapply" command and via
    D-Bus API.
* The API for VPN plugins now supports multiple simultaneous connections.
    Most popular VPN plugins have been updated to support this functionality.
* The libnm library now provides API to access VPN service definitions.
* New DHCP_FQDN key in ifcfg files to configure the full FQDN to be sent to
    the DHCP servers.
* The timeout for DHCP requests can now be modified using the
    'ipv4.dhcp-timeout' property.
* Added multicast_snooping option to BRIDGING_OPTS ifcfg key.
* Added support for detecting duplicate IPv4 addresses, with a timeout
    configurable through the ipv4.dad-timeout connection property.
* Fixed a race condition that could potentially lead to unauthorized access
    to connection secrets (CVE-2016-0764).
* dnsmasq configuration for shared connections can now be extended by
    placing custom files in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq-shared.d/.
* Generic devices are no longer assumed unless explicitly requested by
    user.
* The reorder-header VLAN flag setting is now honored; to keep backwards
    compatibility in behavior, an existing REORDER_HDR=0 ifcfg-rh key is
    ignored; the flag must be disabled with VLAN_FLAGS=NO_REORDER_HDR.
* NetworkManager now checks the connection data from client for validity
    and gracefully handles unknown properties in client. This improves
    interoperability between the server and clients of different versions.
* The activation of a VLAN device with a virtual parent that is inactive
    now results in a parent being activated first.
* The server name used with 802.1x authentication can now be constrained
    to a particular domain suffix (CVE-2006-7246).
* Fair amount of bugs was fixed and robustness was generally improved.

The following features were backported to 1.0.x releases from 1.0.0 to 1.0.10
are also present in NetworkManager-1.2:

* Added support for handling VPN secrets to nmtui and nmcli agent.
* The team devices can now properly be enslaved to bridges.
* Failed DHCP attempts for assumed connections are now retried after
    a timeout.
* Default wired connection is now created after udev registers the device.
* Support for Bluetooth DUN devices with Bluez 5 has been fixed.
* The 'ipv6.ignore-auto-dns' property is now properly honored making it
    possible to override automatically obtained name servers.
* Invalid permanent MAC addresses as reported by some devices are now
    ignored.
* Device links reported by more recent versions of Linux kernel that reside
    in different network namespaces are no longer confused with links in
    the namespace NetworkManager runs in.
* MAC address changes of bond or team devices are now properly propagated
    to VLANs created on the device.
* Fixed error handling for teaming devices with invalid configuration.
* Wi-Fi AP list is now updated correctly after AP mode has been used.
* The error handling for VPN secret agents is now significantly more robust.
* Detection of s390 CTC devices now works properly.
* A GATEWAY key in in /etc/sysconfig/network now no longer affects
    non-static connections.
* Added support for IPv6-only VPN connections.
* The systemd service now uses HUP signal to reload configuration.

* nmtui is now able to ignore automatically configured routes.
* Allow setting IPv6 and PPP settings for GDM and CDMA connections via
    nmcli.
* Added support for adding ADSL connections in nmcli.
* Improved capture portal detection.
* Default route through WiFi connection is now preferred to Mobile
    Broadband if both are available.
* Expose a flag to determine whether a particular connection is metered
    via API and client tools. Configurable in ifcfg with CONNECTION_METERED
    key.
* Add support for locking connections to a channel within a particular
    band.
* Add support for configuring Wake-on-LAN capabilitites.
* Allow overriding the MTU for team device.
* The MTU setting from an IPv6 neighbor discovery Router Advertisements is
    now ignored if applying it would result in invalid configuration.
* Some configuration options can now be changed without restarting the
    daemon. Notably, this applies to 'dns', 'connectivity' and
    'ignore-carrier' settings.
* The connection activation was made more robust. If an active connection
    is reactivated, the device it is active on takes precedence. If an attempt
    is made to activate a connection on a different device than the one it is
    active on, the activation proceeds removing the connection from the active
    device.
* The device specifiers in configuration files now support negation via
    'except:' match.
* Devices that only have IPv6 link-local address are no longer assumed to
    be connected.
* nmcli now provides hints and tab-completion for enumeration properties.
* If the IPv6 interface tokens are set they are honored when creating an
    interface identifier for IPv6 addressing.
* NetworkManager now maintains correct routing configuration when multiple
    interfaces are connected to the same network.
* The management of devices can now be controlled with udev rules. The veth
    devices as well as the virtual Ethernet devices of various
    virtualization tools (VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels Workstation) are
    now ignored by default.
* The IPv6 privacy extensions are now enabled by default and handling of
    the ip6-privacy sysctl has been improved.
* Activating a Bond, Bridge or Team device can now optionally activate the
    slave connections as well. The behavior is controlled with
    'connection.autoconnect-slaves' property and AUTOCONNECT-SLAVES key in
    ifcfg files.
* The platform support code has been refactored, resulting in better
    scalability in large configurations.
* Changes to network interfaces configuration done outside NetworkManager
    are now picked up and exposed to the user via NetworkManager API and tools.
* A connection can now optionally leave externally configured default route
    in place instead of overriding it. The behavior is controlled with
    'ipv4.never-default' and 'ipv6.never-default' properties.
* nmcli allows multiple devices for 'nmcli device disconnect/delete'.
* Firewall zone is added to firewalld for device-based VPN connections too.
* Wi-Fi devices now indicate support for 2GHz and 5GHz frequencies
* "nmcli device" output now indicates physical port ID
* New config items added to the 'ifcfg-rh' plugin:
  - IPV4_ROUTE_METRIC and IPV6_ROUTE_METRIC
  - DEVTIMEOUT
  - IPADDR and PREFIX are now supported for specifying address ranges of
      shared IPv4 connections
* Dispatcher scripts now get a CONNECTION_FILENAME variable with the path
    to the configuration file for the connection
* An example dispatcher script that is able to apply complex routing rules
    (such as setting up policy-based routing) for 'ifcfg-rh' connections was
    added to examples/dispatcher/.
* 'mode' key of Bond device options property now accepts numeric values
* Connection attempts for devices without carrier on startup now wait for
    carrier to appear within a short timeout instead of failing
    immediately. This makes system startup more robust.
* Bridge connectivity is now properly restored on resume from suspend
* The D-Bus name is acquired earlier during the daemon startup. This makes
    it possible for the systemd service manager to optimize the service
    startup so that services that require networking are activated sooner
    contributing to faster system start up time.
* A lot of memory leak problems were fixed, resulting in reduced memory usage.
    Many of them were discovered as a result of improvements in use of
    Valgrind in the testing infrastructure.
* Management of 'teamd' daemon instances for Team devices is now more robust.
* The 'dnsmasq' daemon respawns when it terminates and it is configured for
    management of DNS resolver configuration
* Hostnames that are not fully qualified are no longer sent to a DHCPv6
    server for a dynamic DNS update
* Connection UUIDs are now checked for uniqueness when connection
    configurations are read
* Receipt of a NDP Router Advertisement can no longer lower the IPv6 hop
    limit (CVE-2015-2924)

===============================================
NetworkManager-1.0
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-0.9.10
===============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* A new 'libnm' GObject-based client library to replace libnm-util/libnm-glib
  - IP address, IP route, hardware address, and other properties are now
      represented as strings
  - Based on GIO's GDBus bindings instead of dbus-glib
  - Uses modern GObject APIs including GAsyncResult and GVariant
  - For more information see https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/NetworkManager/libnm
* Devices and VPN connections now have individual default routes.  Priorities
    are handled through configurable route metrics.
* nmcli now supports password requests and PolicyKit authorizations
* A faster, lighter-weight (though less capable) internal DHCP client has been
    added and may be selected with the "dhcp=internal" option.  It supports
    fewer DHCP options and does not yet support DHCPv6.
* A new 'configure-and-quit=yes' option has been added for environments with
    less dynamic network configuration
* When running on 3.17 and later kernels, NetworkManager handles IPv6LL address
    assignment to ensure that IPv6 connectivity is not enabled until
    intentionally configured by the user
* NetworkManager no longer causes the nl80211 kernel module to be loaded on
    systems with no Wi-Fi devices
* Bluetooth DUN support now works with Bluez 5.x
* VPN connections can now persist across link changes and suspend/resume if
    their VPN plugin supports this feature
* A new 'ibft' settings plugin has been added to support firmware-based
    iBFT/iSCSI configurations.  This functionality has been moved to 'ibft'
    from the 'ifcfg-rh' plugin.
