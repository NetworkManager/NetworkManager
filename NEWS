NetworkManager-1.0.12
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-1.0.10
===============================================

* DHCP leases on software devices are now renewed when the computer is
  awoken from suspend.

* Improved ifupdown plugin robustness and interoperability on Yocto and
  OpenEmbedded.

* Fixed failed VPN activations when plugin supports interactive mode, but
  the VPN daemon does not.

* Wi-Fi monitor interfaces are now ignored, not turned into managed mode.

* AP and AdHoc mode connections with manual IP configuration are now able
  to autoconnect.

* Broken device drivers (AWS ENI) that initially have invalid MAC addresses
  are now properly managed as soon as correct MAC address is set.

* WWAN devices are unlocked a bit earlier so that supported IP versions can
  be queried.

* The NetworkManager.service was ordered after network-pre.target and
  dbus.service. This ensures NetworkManager doesn't set up connectivity
  before firewall rules are in place and wouldn't exit before remote
  filesystems can be umounted ensuring orderly operation of systemd
  managed installations.

* The netfilter rules used with shared IPv4 method are now removed on exit.

* Ability to manage USB gadget drivers (UDC side) has beed added.

* Infiniband transport mode change now takes place with the link set down
  because some drivers need that.

* Race conditions that could disclose connection secrets to authenticated
  local users when changing ifcfg and keyfile connections have been fixed.
  This has security impact of low severity. (CVE-2016-0764)

* A handful of memory leak and crasher bugs of minor importance have been
  fixed.

===============================================
NetworkManager-1.0.4
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-1.0.2
===============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* The MTU setting from an IPv6 neighbor discovery Router Advertisements is
    now ignored if applying it would result in invalid configuration.

* Some configuration options can now be changed without restarting the
    daemon. Notably, this applies to 'dns', 'connectivity' and
    'ignore-carrier' settings.

* The connection activation was made more robust. If an active connection
    is reactivated, the device it's active on takes precedence. If an attempt
    is made to activate a connection on a different device than it is active on,
    the activation proceeds removing the connection from the active device.

* The device specifiers in configuration files now support negation via
    'except:' match.

* Devices that only have IPv6 link-local address are no longer assumed to
    be connected.

* nmcli now provides hints and tab-completion for enumeration properties.

* If the IPv6 interface tokens are set they are honored when creating an
    interface identifier for IPv6 addressing.

* NetworkManager now maintains correct routing configuration when multiple
    interfaces are connected to the same network.

* The management of devices can now be controlled with udev rules. The veth
    devices as well as the virtual Ethernet devices of various
    virtualization tools (VMWare, VirtualBox, Parallels Workstation) are
    now ignored by default.

* The IPv6 privacy extensions are now enabled by default and handling of
    the ip6-privacy sysctl has been improved.

* Activating a Bond, Bridge or Team device can now optionally activate the
    slave connections as well. The behavior is controlled with
    'connection.autoconnect-slaves' property.

* The platform support code has been refactored, resulting in better
    scalability in large configurations.

* Changes to network interfaces configuration done outside NetworkManager
    are now picked up and exposed to the user via NetworkManager API and tools.

* A connection can now optionally leave externally configured default route
    in place instead of overriding it. The behavior is controlled with
    'ipv4.never-default' and 'ipv6.never-default' properties.

* Multiple crasher and memory leak bugs in the daemon were fixed.

* Multiple bugs that could cause the client tools to hang or crash were fixed.

* nmcli allows multiple devices for 'nmcli device disconnect/delete'.

* Firewall zone is added to firewalld for device-based VPN connections too.

===============================================
NetworkManager-1.0.2
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-1.0
===============================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager.  Notable changes include:

* Wi-Fi devices now indicate support for 2GHz and 5GHz frequencies
* "nmcli device" output now indicates physical port ID
* New config items added to the 'ifcfg-rh' plugin:
  - IPV4_ROUTE_METRIC and IPV6_ROUTE_METRIC
  - DEVTIMEOUT
  - IPADDR and PREFIX are now supported for specifying address ranges of
      shared IPv4 connections
* Dispatcher scripts now get a CONNECTION_FILENAME variable with the path
    to the configuration file for the connection
* An example dispatcher script that is able to apply complex routing rules
    (such as setting up policy-based routing) for 'ifcfg-rh' connections was
    added to examples/dispatcher/.
* 'mode' key of Bond device options property now accepts numeric values
* Connection attempts for devices without carrier on startup now wait for
    carrier to appear within a short timeout instead of failing
    immediately. This makes system startup more robust.
* Bridge connectivity is now properly restored on resume from suspend
* The D-Bus name is acquired earlier during the daemon startup. This makes
    it possible for the systemd service manager to optimize the service
    startup so that services that require networking are activated sooner
    contributing to faster system start up time.
* A lot of memory leak problems were fixed, resulting in reduced memory usage.
    Many of them were discovered as a result of improvements in use of
    Valgrind in the testing infrastructure.
* Management of 'teamd' daemon instances for Team devices is now more robust.
* The 'dnsmasq' daemon respawns when it terminates and it is configured for
    management of DNS resolver configuration
* Hostnames that are not fully qualified are no longer sent to a DHCPv6
    server for a dynamic DNS update
* Connection UUIDs are now checked for uniqueness when connection
    configurations are read

    limit (CVE-2015-2924)

* Updates to Telugu, Turkish, Polish, German, Gujarati, Italian and Russian
    translations
