#define DESCRIBE_DOC_NM_SETTING_WIRELESS_CLONED_MAC_ADDRESS N_("If specified, request that the device use this MAC address instead. This is known as MAC cloning or spoofing. Beside explicitly specifying a MAC address, the special values \"preserve\", \"permanent\", \"random\" and \"stable\" are supported. \"preserve\" means not to touch the MAC address on activation. \"permanent\" means to use the permanent hardware address of the device. \"random\" creates a random MAC address on each connect. \"stable\" creates a hashed MAC address based on connection.stable-id and a machine dependent key. If unspecified, the value can be overwritten via global defaults, see manual of NetworkManager.conf. If still unspecified, it defaults to \"preserve\" (older versions of NetworkManager may use a different default value). On D-Bus, this field is expressed as \"assigned-mac-address\" or the deprecated \"cloned-mac-address\".")
#define DESCRIBE_DOC_NM_SETTING_WIRELESS_GENERATE_MAC_ADDRESS_MASK N_("With \"cloned-mac-address\" setting \"random\" or \"stable\", by default all bits of the MAC address are scrambled and a locally-administered, unicast MAC address is created. This property allows to specify that certain bits are fixed. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address. If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a default connection setting. If the value is still NULL or an empty string, the default is to create a locally-administered, unicast MAC address. If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask. The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization. Setting \"FE:FF:FF:00:00:00\" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the \"random\" or \"stable\" algorithm. If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that shall not be randomized. For example, a value of \"FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00\" will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized. A value of \"02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00\" will create a fully scrambled globally-administered, burned-in MAC address. If the value contains more than one additional MAC addresses, one of them is chosen randomly. For example, \"02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00\" will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally administered.")

In infrastructure mode, various workarounds are used for a more reliable discovery of hidden networks, such as probe-scanning the SSID.  However, these workarounds expose inherent insecurities with hidden SSID networks, and thus hidden SSID networks should be used with caution. In AP mode, the created network does not broadcast its SSID. Note that marking the network as hidden may be a privacy issue for you (in infrastructure mode) or client stations (in AP mode), as the explicit probe-scans are distinctly recognizable on the air.")
