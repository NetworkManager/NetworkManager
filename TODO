TODO items for NetworkManager
-----------------------------

Any of these items are of course fair game for anyone, patches are greatly welcome.  It also serves as a "what still needs to be done" list.

- Access Point link checking thresholds

Wireless link checking could be enhanced to check the signal strength of an access point and switch if the current access point a wireless card is associated with has dropped below say, 20%.


- Gracefully recover from dbus and hal dropouts

There is currently no logic to gracefully recover from a crashed/killed dbus or hal.  There are dbus functions for notification when services come up and go away which could be used here.  Remeber that when dbus dies, hal also dies at the moment.


- Store Allowed Network WEP keys in gnome-keyring

These keys should probably be encrypted, rather than being stored in GConf.


- Support 40/64 bit passphrases

Allow user to enter passphrases and convert them to 40/64 bit WEP keys on the fly.  Unfortunately, the algorithm for 40/64 bit passphrases is kind of messy.
