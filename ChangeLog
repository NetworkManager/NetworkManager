	* Merge Peter Jones' completion patch, reducing latency and speeding
		up wait times for device activation and wireless scanning


2005-03-28  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Bill Moss:
	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_policy_allowed_ap_list_update): merge properties
			for all wireless devices on update, not just active device

2005-03-28  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Add some more contributors to the About dialog

2005-03-28  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (mdio_read): Fix two bugs that caused all devices to fail
			the MII carrier detection support checks

2005-03-22  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Bill Moss:
	* src/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
		- (nmi_dbus_update_network_auth_method, nmi_dbus_get_network_properties):
			free leaked GConf values

2005-03-12  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Nathaniel McCallum:
	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_set_wireless_config): Increase timeout for some devices

2005-03-04  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Peter Jones:
	- Make stuff work with gcc 4.0

2005-02-28  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Tag STABLE_0_3_4_RELEASE

	* configure.in:
		- Bump version to 0.3.4

2005-02-27  Jim Huang  <jserv@kaffe.org>

	* configure.in: Added "zh_TW" (Traditional Chinese) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-02-27  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Bill Moss:
	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- Make sure strength for current access point is up-to-date when we
			update the gui data model

2005-02-27  Alessio Frusciante  <algol@firenze.linux.it>

	* configure.in: Added "it" (Italian) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2005-02-27  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- (nm_system_init): Kill any dhclient processes lying around as well
			as stopping 'nifd' if its already been started.  NetworkManager
			subsumes the functions of nifd (kicking mDNSResponder, autoip)

2005-02-27  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- (nmwa_destroy): Really mean to destroy GUI data model first, then
			dbus data model, not the GUI data model twice.

2005-02-27  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
	  panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- Move to incremental network updates.  Instead of blowing away our list
			of devices every time we get a signal from NetworkManager, we now
			incrementally add/remove networks when NetworkManager notifies us that
			a new network has appeared or disappered.  Strength updates now happen
			on-the-fly for each access point as well.  There are now two copies of
			data from NetworkManager: one for the dbus side, and one for the gui side.
			When the dbus side data is modified, it is copied over to the gui side
			so we don't have to hold the data_mutex for long periods of time (and
			therefore block animation of the applet's icon).
		- Clean up some memleaks too

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletOtherNetworkDialog.c
		- Minor code beautification

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
		- (nm_ap_list_merge_scanned_ap): return whether or not the access point is
			completely new and whether or not an existing one's strength was updated.
			Try to fix multiple access points and signal strength by using the highest
			signal strength in each scan for any given ESSID.

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- (nm_dbus_signal_wireless_network_change): consolidate signals that deal with
			wireless networks; now we have only WirelessNetworkUpdate which includes
			a UINT32 for Appeared, Disappeared, or StrengthChanged (see NetworkManager.h).
		- Kill usage of DbusMessageIter

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_wireless_process_scan_results): Use the same timestamp for all APs
			in the same scan result list.  Copy ESSIDs-by-address earlier on, for each
			AP rather than all-at-once.  Also don't ever remove the AP a card is
			currently associated with from the network list.
		- Update for new signals during scan, send out Appeared, Disappeared, or
			StrengthChanged when necessary.

2005-02-25  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* README
		- Line break the README

2005-02-25  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletOtherNetworkDialog.c
		- Remove usage of gtk_window_set_default_size()

	* panel-applet/essid.glade
		- Stick default size here
		- Add in random crap that current glade wants to add in now

2005-02-25  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- For non-caching-nameserver/non-named case, ensure that nscd is running
			and that we actually tell nscd to reload the hosts cache when it changes

2005-02-25  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
		- (nmi_dbus_get_network_properties): whack usage of DbusMessageIter

	* test/nminfotest.c
		- Whack usage of DbusMessageIter
		- Clean up DbusError and DbusMessage handling and freeing
		- Remove unused unregister handler

	* test/nmtest.c
		- Whack usage of DbusMessageIter

	* test/nmtestdevices.c
		- Whack usage of DbusMessageIter

2005-02-25  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* NetworkManager.h
		- New signal type NMNetworkStatus in preparation for the "WirelessNetworkUpdate"
			signal

2005-02-25  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* named/nm-named-manager.c
		- Ensure that pid and watch variables for child named process get cleared out
			when the child goes away.

2005-02-22  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_policy_activation_finish): Deactivate a device if its activation fails,
			and NULL out data->active_device so that we have to choose another one.
			This may make NetworkManager keep attempting to connect to a wired network
			if it fails, but if it keeps failing the wired network has more problems than
			just NetworkManager.

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- (nm_system_update_dns): fix to actually run nscd -i hosts when nscd
			is already running

	* named/nm-named-manager.c
		- (rewrite_resolv_conf): Call nm_system_update_dns() when not using
			named so that the distro can flush whatever name service caching
			daemon it uses

2005-02-21  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDHCP.[ch]
		- (nm_device_dhcp_remove_timeouts): new function

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Use nm_device_dhcp_remove_timeouts() everywhere that we need to
			remove the DHCP timeouts.

2005-02-21  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
	  panel-applet/menu-info.[ch]
		- Give the panel applet some major love: menu items are no longer
			subclasses of GtkCheckMenuItem, they are actual GtkCheckMenuItems.
			This allows the applet to actually reflect theme changes correctly,
			since themeing of subclassed items in GTK _sucks_.

2005-02-18  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* libnm_glib/libnm_glib.[ch]
	  test/libnm_glib_test.c
		- Clean up libnm_glib API a bit, callback is now passed a libnm_glib_ctx
			and its data, and doesn't have to free the callback data anymore

2005-02-18  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Revert 2005-02-18 William Jon McCann fix for standard
			copyright string until it passes 'make distcheck'.
			With standard copyright string, xgettext complains
			about "Non-ASCII string at ...".

2005-02-18  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/essid.glade
	  panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletOtherNetworksDialog.c
		- Correct spelling of "adaptor"->"adapter"

2005-02-18  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c: Use GTK_CHECK_VERSION() macro.
	(nmwa_about_cb): Use standard copyright string.  Update comment
	text to reflect that it is a notification area applet.  Remove
	leading newline in authors list.
	(nmwa_menu_show_cb, nmwa_setup_widgets): Populate menu on show
	instead of on parent menu item activation.  Fixes #167550.

2005-02-18  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* panel-applet/essid.glade: Capitalize items as per HIG.
	  Fixes #167632

2005-02-16  William Jon McCann  <mccann@jhu.edu>

	* panel-applet/gtkcellrendererprogress.[ch]: Only compile these
	files for GTK 2.4 or lower, since now public in GTK 2.6.

	* panel-applet/essid.glade: Don't specify window size.

			mii.h headers are broken, and instead use our own typedefs

2005-02-10  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* dhcpcd/buildmsg.c
		- (fill_host_and_class_id): only fill in client and class IDs if
			they are set by callers.

	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- (class_id_setup): don't autogenerate a class ID, only use one
			we're given, if any.
		- (client_id_setup): don't autogenerate a client ID, only use one
			we're given, if any.

	* dhcpcd/dhcpcd.c
		- (dhcp_interface_init): ensure that client options are correctly
			NULL terminated

	* src/NetworkManagerDHCP.c
		- (nm_device_dhcp_request): pass hostname to dhcp library

2005-02-10  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	  src/backends/NetworkManagerDebian.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerSlackware.c
		- Remove the nm_system_device_run_dhcp() and nm_system_device_stop_dhcp()

			during the support check

	Patch from Dave Woodhouse:

		- (in_cksum): copy last byte of odd-sized packets into a
			'u_short' rather than a 'u_char', should fix wrong checksums
			on big-endian platforms

2005-02-09  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Clean up usage of GSList objects and looping through their members
	* Clean up DHCP rebind/renew timeouts, hopefully they will work correctly
		now.
	* Fix problem where even if scanning was turned off, card would still
		cycle through frequencies.

2005-02-08  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Fix for gtk 2.4

2005-02-08  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

		- Restore correct ESSID in tooltips

2005-02-07  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Add a context menu that contains:
			Pause/Resume Wireless Scanning
			Stop/Start All Wireless Devices
			About...
		- Grab active device strength off active device,
			not its network

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- Add DBUS accessors for "getSupportsCarrierDetect", "setScanningEnabled",
			"getScanningEnabled", "setWirelessEnabled", and "getWirelessEnabled"
		- Update active device strength every 2 seconds, not every 1 second

	* panel-applet/menu-info.c
		- Only disable wired devices in the menu when they support carrier detection,
			and don't currently have a link.  Non-carrier-detect devices will always
			remain choosable

	* src/Makefile.am
	  src/NetworkManagerDbusUtils.[ch]
		- Add new new dbus utils sources

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Fixes for new link detection, we no longer need to call nm_device_update_link_active()
			with the boolean parameter
		- Set scanning_enabled & wireless_enabled to TRUE

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Use new dbus util method dispatcher functions for org.freedesktop.NetworkManager methods
		- Implement scanning & wireless enable/disable calls
		- Remove the dbus vtable unregister handlers, weren't doing anything with them anyway

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- New link detection stuff again...
			o  Create device's mainloop earlier (but don't run it earlier)
			o  Hook up new carrier-detect support stuff
			o  Add in the ethtool & mii support detection code
		- Don't scan if scanning is disabled

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Never automatically choose a device that doesn't support carrier detection
		- Don't automatically choose a wireless device if wireless is disabled

2005-02-07  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* libnm_glib/libnm_glib.c
		- Small cleanup in element list iteration

2005-02-07  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- (nm_wireless_qual_to_percent): Fix up wireless quality calculations
			to be in line with the WEXT quality specification

2005-02-02  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Nathan Fredrickson <nathan@silverorange.com>
	* Fix up compile for deprecation of libgnomeui

		- Remove <libgnomeui/libgnomeui.h> includes
		- Use gtk_window_set_default_icon_from_file() rather than
			gnome_window_set_default_icon_from_file()

	* named/nm-named-manager.c
		- (generate_named_conf): Fix return-nothing in non-void
			function

2005-02-02  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Clean up unused variables and the like

2005-02-02  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
		- (nm_ap_list_merge_scanned_ap): merge strength too

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.c
		- (nm_lock_mutex, nm_register_mutex_desc): new calls to facilitate debugging
			of locking issues by printing out prettier information than g_mutex_lock
		- Print out names of mutexes registered with nm_register_mutex_desc()
		- (nm_try_lock_mutex): don't do the waiting thing when trying to lock, causes
			us to seemingly block here for too long

	* src/NetworkManager.c
	  src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Convert to using nm_lock_mutex/nm_unlock_mutex rather than the glib variants
			so we get better debug information printed

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_devices_handle_request): reduce usage of nm_device_need_ap_switch()
			since it sometimes has locking side effects
		- (nm_device_get_association_pause_value): Reduce 802.11a card pause value to 8s
			from 10s
		- (nm_device_need_ap_switch): If we can't acquire the scan lock, return saying
			we don't need a switch.  This gets called often enough that we can't block
			until the scan mutex is acquired, because we'll block on device activation
			and a few other things, which hangs main thread for too long.

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_policy_auto_get_best_device): reduce the possiblity that
			nm_device_need_ap_switch() will be called		

2005-02-02  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Display name of wireless network we are connecting to or connected to
			in the tooltip of the applet

2005-02-02  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDHCP.c
		- Hopefully fix double-default-route problem by cleaning up the default
			route added by DHCP code right before the DHCP transaction begins

2005-02-02  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* named/nm-named-manager.c
		- Write out valid resolv.conf when we exit

2005-02-01  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Colin Walters:
	* named/nm-named-manager.c
		- Make multi-domain search options work

2005-01-31  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
		- (nmi_dbus_nmi_message_handler): make sure 'dialog' exists before using it

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_new): Don't store the entire range struct, use only what we need
			(which is currently avg_quality, max_quality, and frequencies).  Also
			zero device structure when we've free'd it to maybe expose errors down
			the line.
		- (nm_device_update_signal_strength): grab the scan mutex before getting
			quality data from the card since quality will be useless during a scan.
			Call updated wireless qual-to-percent function with values stored in
			nm_device_new() earlier.
		- Remove some unused functions (nm_device_get_max_quality(), nm_device_get_noise(),
			nm_device_get_bad_crypt_packets())
		- (nm_device_activate_wireless_adhoc): use new frequency values we go in
			nm_device_new()
		- (get_initial_auth_method): always use the Auth method that's in the allowed
			list if available.  Problem was this: when the WEP key is wrong, NM will
			try OS then SK modes, and then get stuck in SK mode after that.  This
			should reset it.
		- (nm_device_wireless_process_scan_results): work with new qual-to-percent
			function

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- (nm_wireless_qual_to_percent): try to make this function actually work and
			mimic iwlib behavior.  Use card's idea of quality divided by max_qual
			if that's all present, otherwise fall back to signal-to-noise ratios.

2005-01-29  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscript/RedHat/NetworkManager
		- Don't spit out sysctl stuff to console

	* libnm_glib/libnm_glib.c
		- (libnm_glib_init): call dbus_g_thread_init()

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- (nmwa_dbus_worker): call dbus_g_thread_init()

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- (main): call dbus_g_thread_init()

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
		- (nm_ap_list_print_members): use LOG_ERR instead of LOG_DEBUG
			so we can actually see what's there in a normal syslog

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activate_wireless): print out the "waiting for access point"
			message only once, then say what access point we actually got after
			the wait.
		- (nm_device_need_ap_switch): If a scan is in progress when we're in this
			function, wait until the scan is done.  Scans may change the ESSID of
			the card, making this function think we need to switch access points
		- (nm_device_wireless_process_scan_results): for artificial access points
			don't check against the card's ESSID, but the best_ap's ESSID.  This
			prevents collisions with the scanning code, which may change the card's
			ESSID and cause the access point to get dropped from the device's AP
			list.  Also increase the keep-around time to 2m from 60s since the max
			scan interval could be 60s in some cases.

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_policy_activation_finish): Don't add invalid MAC addresses to GConf
		- (nm_policy_allowed_ap_list_update): When we update, make sure we copy over
			the new properties and ESSIDs to the device's AP list.  Fixes some races
			between NM and NMI.

2005-01-27  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
		- (nmi_dbus_add_network_address): if the network doesn't yet exist in
			GConf, make a minimal entry for it (essid & timestamp)

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
		- (nm_ap_list_populate_from_nmi): Don't try to grab network data if
			NetworkManagerInfo isn't running

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- (nm_dbus_nmi_is_running): new function

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_wireless_force_use): Don't set the created AP's MAC
			address to garbage.

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_policy_activation_finish): On successful activation, make sure
			the "best" AP has a MAC address, and don't tell NMI to add the
			current AP's MAC address to GConf if the AP is an Ad-hoc AP.
		- (nm_policy_allowed_ap_list_update): Update a wireless card's "best"
			access point after refreshing our allowed list if it doesn't already
			have a "best" access point.

2005-01-25  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- (nmwa_dbus_filter): Fix dbus 0.23 ServiceOwnerChanged checks
			so we check for NM_DBUS_SERVICE rather than not for it

	* libnm_glib/libnm_glib.c
		- (libnm_glib_dbus_filter): Fix for dbus 0.23, trapping
			ServiceOwnerChanged signal

2005-01-25  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* configure.in
		- Check DBUS version in configure, and set the C macros
			DBUS_VERSION_[MAJOR,MINOR,MICRO]

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
		- Remove #if 0-d section of code that quit NMI if NM went away.

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- Trap the "ServiceOwnerChanged" signal that's new in dbus-0.23

	* src/NetworkManager.c
	  src/NetworkManagerMain.h
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Trap the "ServiceOwnerChanged" signal that's new in dbus-0.23
		- Make updating of our Allowed Wireless Network lists from NMI
			an idle function in the main thread now, with a high priority.

2005-01-24  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/gtkcellview.[ch]
	  panel-applet/menu-info.c
		- Fix GTK version checks to be <= rather than <

	* test/Makefile.am
		- Include the libtool archive of libnm_glib rather than
			trying to pull in the .so

2005-01-24  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDevicePrivate.h
		- Block nm_device_new() until our device's worker thread has had a
			chance to start up.  Fixes a race between main thread and worker
			thread starting that caused activation requests to get lost.

2005-01-24  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscript/RedHat/NetworkManager
		- Remove the ### BEGIN INIT INFO section, which caused chkconfig
			to add the NM startup script at priority 50, which was
			way too early

2005-01-24  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* named/named.conf: Use any port for query source instead of
	restricting to port 53.

2005-01-24  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscript/RedHat/NetworkManager
		- Remove the ### BEGIN INIT INFO section, which caused chkconfig
			to add the NM startup script at priority 50, which was
			way too early

2005-01-24  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Tom Parker <palfrey@tevp.net>
	* Fix up compile warnings & errors in the wireless applet

2005-01-24  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Convert 24x24 icons back to 22x22 and use the 22x22 ones

2005-01-24  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/gtkcellview.[ch]
		- Only compile these files for GTK 2.4 or lower, since 
			GtkCellView is now public in GTK 2.6.  Fixes crasher
			when choosing "Other Wireless Networks" from the panel
			applet menu

2005-01-21  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Daemonize earlier so that glib doesn't get confused (?)

2005-01-21  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
	  panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
	  panel-applet/menu-info.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Disable wired devices in the menu when they have no link.

2005-01-21  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Cache last-known-good wireless authentication method in
		NetworkManagerInfo, and use that method first during
		wireless device activation.  Should speed up devices that
		need Shared Key authentication method since Open System is
		now the default.

	* Remove the hack to not do full activation on wired connections
		that are active when we launch, it causes too many problems
		with name resolution and was a hack in the first place.

	* Re-work wireless device activation again somewhat to have a
		clearer chain of events and to use last-known-good
		authentication method of the access point.  Also provide
		better status throughout activation to ensure the applet
		can tell the user exactly what's going on.

	* Remove the "find wireless network" code and now simply attempt
		to activate with that access point.  This reduces the delay
		between selecting "Other wireless Network" and actually
		connecting to that network.

	* Correctly stop the device's worker thread when its removed.

2005-01-21  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- Clean up some of the debug messages

2005-01-21  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Add new icons, more frames of animation
	* Remove some hacks to get the panel applet to display correct
		status, an NM update will soon follow that will fix the
		real issue.

2005-01-19  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@gnome.org>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c: #include <config.h> must be
	the first include for working i18n. Also, don't include it in .h files
	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.h: Same
	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletOtherNetworkDialog.c: Same
	* panel-applet/menu-info.c: Same

2005-01-18  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- Remove some debug messages
		- Wrap others in #ifdef DEBUG/#endif

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Remove some debug messages
		- Clarify some debug messages
		- Remove code related to old single-thread wireless scanning

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- New AP property "last_seen" to track how recently an AP was
			found in a scan
		- Start using 'const' more in function arguments

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- (nm_ap_list_merge_scanned_ap): new, selectively update attributes
			of an AP found in an AP list from a source AP, or if not found
			in the list add the source AP
		- (nm_ap_list_combine): remove, no longer needed

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Each device now has a "worker" thread from start to end of its life.
			Scanning for wireless devices now happens in that thread,
			not in a single "wireless scanning thread" for all devices as
			previously.  Activation consists of adding an idle handler to the
			thread's main loop/context, which gets run at the next available
			opportunity.
		- Wireless scanning is also simplified, there is now only one list of
			access points per wireless device, and APs older than 60s are
			removed from the list.  Previously, we kept results for the last
			3 scans and merged whole lists, which was complicated.
		- Cleaned up activation debug messages.
		- Wireless activation and access-point search routines now use Open System
			authentication before trying Shared Key.
		- Removed some code in nm_device_update_best_ap() that could cause cards
			to loose their link to the access point.
		- Scanning now uses a backoff algorithm, where the inverval becomes
			progressively longer between scans when the list of scanned access
			points doesn't change.  A change will revert to the shortest scan
			interval (20s).

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.[ch]
		- Remove code related to old single-thread wireless scanning

2005-01-18  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDHCP.c (set_nameservers): Free and clear list
	of older nameservers.

2005-01-18  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* named/nm-named-manager.c (generate_named_conf): Many fixes
	to config file generation.
	(safer_kill): Remove, was too much trouble for little gain.
	(nm_named_manager_start): Run named as NM_NAMED_USER.

	* configure.in: Add option --with-named-user.

2005-01-14  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	Patch from ed@catmur.co.uk (Ed Catmur)

	* named/nm-named-manager.c: Add "context" property.
	Use it to add child watch source in specific GMainContext.

	* src/NetworkManager.c (nm_data_new): Initialize
	named with correct main context.  Start named only
	after forking.

2005-01-14  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* named/nm-named-manager.c (generate_named_conf): Write config
	and pid files into NM_NAMED_DATA_DIR; this allows things to
	work better with FC3 named SELinux policy.  Also fix up silly
	format error.

	* configure.in: Add --with-named-dir option.

2005-01-14  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Make named support require passing --with-named.

	* named/nm-named-manager.c: Support writing resolv.conf directly
	without running named.

2005-01-13  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* named/nm-named-manager.c
		- Use syslog(LOG_WARNING) rather than g_warning() (gnome.org #163961)

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Rework wireless link detection code to be more reliable

2005-01-12  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscripts/RedHat/NetworkManager
		- Change initial level to "-" rather than "345" so that
			we don't activate ourselves by default on install

2005-01-12  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* libnm_glib/
		- Client library for applications using glib

	* configure.in
	  various Makefiles
		- Split NM_CFLAGS and NM_LIBS into separate variables
			like DBUS_*, HAL_* and GLIB_*

	* src/NetworkManager.c
	  src/NetworkManagerMain.h
		- (nm_schedule_status_signal_broadcast): at the earliest convenience,
			broadcast a status changed signal over DBUS from the main thread.
			Still unused anywhere for the moment.

	Patch from j@bootlab.org
	* panel_applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Correct INT32->UINT32 mistmatch between NM and the panel applet
			for the "getMode" method call

2005-01-10  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Minor fixups & corrections to "auto" frequency mode, make it
			less chatty with syslog

2005-01-10  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Implement "auto" frequency/channel support, since cards like Atheros
			can't use other frequencies at all when you've told it to use a
			specific one, even for scanning.
		- Grab the scan mutex around places where we can't tolerate wireless
			settings changing underneath us, like nm_device_wireless_network_exists()
			and nm_device_activate_wireless()

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- Back scan interval off to 20s instead of 14s

2005-01-09  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Don't set mode/freq/bitrate if that mode/freq/bitrate is
			already set.  Stops some drivers like Atmel from continually
			reloading the firmware, which they do upon every configuration
			change.

2005-01-09  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- Use correct timeout value

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Consolidate communication between NM and NMI by doing only 1 dbus
			method call to get Wireless Network info from NMI instead of 6

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Make sure to cancel activation when we receive a SIGTERM, otherwise
			when we didn't have an AP to use, we'd wait for one forever without
			quitting

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- nm_device_activation_cancel(): Fix a race between dhcp and quitting
			activation, dhcp might not have started yet but we don't quit activation
			before starting it, so the quit signal gets lost

2005-01-07  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- Rework the DHCP client code to be much less chatty when
			it receives non-DHCP UDP packets during the DHCP run
			(reported by and preliminary patches from Bill Moss)

	* Move wireless scanning to a separate thread.  This thread forwards the
		results to the main thread when done where they are integrated into
		the device's access point lists.  This keeps the main thread (which
		does all the DBUS communication) from being blocked for long periods
		of time by wireless scanning.

	* Make state modification an idle routine in the main loop, and trigger
		state changes rather than polling for them.

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
		- Fix up invalid C90 code (reported by Christoph Ruessler)

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Revert IPv6 patch for wired devices from 2004-12-22 for
			router advertisements, causing problems and infinite loop
			during "best" device determination due to link going up/down
			(reported by Bill Moss)

	Apply patch from Peter Jones
	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Shortcut for link-checking for ipw2x00 cards
		- Split out association check into separate routine

2004-01-05  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* named/named.conf: Add PID_FILE.

	* named/nm-named-manager.c: Always generate a pid
	file, since older BIND versions don't support
	"pid-file none".

2005-01-01  Satoru SATOH <ss@gnome.gr.jp>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added ja (Japanese).

2004-12-22  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Silently fail when setting bitrate doesn't work


	Patches from j@bootlab.org:
	* src/backends/NetworkManagerDebian
		- Update backend to match functionality in RedHat backend
	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Take down then bring up wired devices after connection so
		they send out ipv6 router advertisements

2004-12-21  Colin Walters  <walters@verbum.org>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c (nmwa_dbus_update_devices): Correctly
	test for NETWORK_MODE_ADHOC; spotted by: Greg <gonufer@gmail.com>.

2004-12-21  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Correct named detection.

2004-12-21  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManager.c (nm_data_new): Initialize named.
	Also, set up a signal handler for SIGINT/SIGTERM, and exit
	the mainloop when these signals are received.
	(nm_data_free): Unref named.
	(sigterm_handler, sigterm_pipe_handler): New functions for
	exiting mainloop.
	
	* src/NetworkManagerMain.h (NMData): Add signal handling and
	nameserver bits.

	* src/NetworkManager.c (nm_device_unref): Quit device mainloop on
	unref.

	* src/NetworkManagerDHCP.c (set_nameservers): New function;
	set nameservers from DHCP response data.
	(set_domain_search): Set domain search from DHCP response.
	(nm_device_dhcp_configure): Invoke them.

	* src/NetworkManagerSystem.c
	(nm_system_device_update_resolv_conf): Delete.  Deleting
	code is totally sweet.

	* src/Makefile.am (NetworkManager_LDADD): Add libnamed.

	* named/nm-named-manager.h, named/nm-named-manager.c: New files;
	implements an object which controls a nameserver.  Currently
	uses bind 9.

	* configure.in: Check for named.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add named dir.

	* named/named.conf: New template config file.

2004-12-20  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c (nm_policy_get_best_device): Fix usage of '=='
	instead of '='.

2004-12-17  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Ad Ad-Hoc networking mode support.  In Ad-Hoc mode, we only try to get
		link-local addresses instead of doing DHCP.

	* In the panel applet, there's a new "Create new Wireless Network..." item

	* The panel applet also sticks around now even if NetworkManager dies, but
		it doesn't hide its icon when NM isn't around.  Not hiding the icon is
		a bug, I'll fix that later.

	* We also don't use 'nscd' anymore in the RH backend, it was impeding name
		lookups after a switch rather than actually doing them.

	* Clean up some of those warnings in nm_ap_list_* functions

	* Delay between scans changed to 15s instead of 10s

2004-12-15  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Patch from Tom Parker
	* Add autoip/Link Local Addressing support when we fail to get a DHCP
		address

	* Longer pause after setting ESSID on cards that support a larger number
		of channels to give the card time to find the right channel

	* Add system hook to restart mDNSResponder (or whatever the local implementation
		of Multicast DNS is) when we activate interfaces

2004-12-15  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Rework the DHCP code again to revert to sending full ethernet frames
		rather then relying on the kernel to do the right thing with our
		packets.

2004-12-06  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- Fix some minor errors in dhcp_handle_transaction() that caused
			unexpected early timeouts of DHCP transactions

	* dhcpcd/client.h
		- DHCP retransmit time from 4s -> 5s

2004-12-05  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Major rework of the DHCP code, taking some cues from pump.  We don't
		write raw Ethernet packets anymore, which simplifies the code quite
		a bit.  The new code should be more robust, not hang in recvfrom()
		as much, and generally work better.  This also means that we need
		to force HAL/dbus to use a created GMainContext rather than the
		default context, since having the DHCP renew/rebind thread using
		its own GMainContext seemed to give dbus a fit.  There is also more
		debugging information printed from the DHCP loop to help with future
		problems.

	* Also, if the DHCP server doesn't give us the "routersOnSubnet" option,
		assume that the default gateway should be the DHCP server.

	Patch from Matthew Schick <matt oss-institute org>
	* src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
		- Fix compilation error due to missing "ip4_broadcast"

2004-12-03  Dan Williams  <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscript/Makefile.am
	* initscript/Debian/NetworkManager
	* initscript/Gentoo/NetworkManager
	* initscript/RedHat/NetworkManager
	* initscript/NMLaunchHelper.c
		- Remove NMLaunchHelper, if you need to wait until the network
			comes up, use the dead code from CVS.

2004-12-01  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>
	
	* configure.in: Suck in gcc warnings code from Rhythmbox,
	but use fewer default flags, and in particular add -Wno-unused,
	since the codebase has a lot of unused variables.

	* test/nmtestdevices.c (create_device): 
	* test/nminfotest.c (get_network_string_property)

2004-12-01  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c (nmi_dbus_return_vpn_password): New method.
	(nmi_dbus_get_vpn_userpass): New method.
	(nmi_dbus_nmi_message_handler): Invoke it.

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.h (nmi_dbus_return_vpn_password): Prototype.

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoVPN.h,
	info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoVPN.c: New files; responds
	to requests for VPN passwords.

	* configure.in (GNOME_KEYRING_LIBS): Check for gnome-keyring.

2004-12-01  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* test/nmtestdevices.c, test/nmclienttest.c: Add missing
	includes.

2004-12-01  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
	(nmwa_dbus_update_active_device_strength): Fix missing
	return value.

2004-12-01  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c: Add missing include.

2004-12-01  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c (nm_wireless_qual_to_percent):
	Remove useless CLAMP (); the value is unsigned, and the case tests
	qual->qual < 100, so the value must always be between 0 and 100.

2004-12-01  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* dhcpcd/buildmsg.c, dhcpcd/dhcp_test.c: Add missing includes.

2004-11-22  Colin Walters  <walters@verbum.org>

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c (nm_system_update_dns): Run
	"nscd -i hosts" to invalidate the host cache instead of restarting nscd,
	which is essentially a noop since nscd caches hosts on disk too.
	
2004-11-22  Colin Walters  <walters@redhat.com>

	* src/Makefile.am (NetworkManager_SOURCES): Add
	NetworkManagerDevicePrivate.h.

2004-11-22  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevicePrivate.h
		- Split out the NMDevice struct to a different file so that stuff like
			NetworkManagerDHCP.c and NetworkManagerSystem.c can use it

	* dhcpcd/client.c
		- fprintf->syslog
		- (dhcpSendAndRecv): do non-blocking sends and receives, and check to see if we
			need to cancel the dhcp request during the send and recv

	* dhcpcd/client.h
		- Move the DHCP option enum to dhcpcd.h

	* src/NetworkManagerDHCP.c
		- Split out the actual IP/netmask/etc setting code
		- New Renew/Rebind functions
		- New timer setup function for renew/rebind operations

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- For device activation, if we are using DHCP then keep the activation thread
			alive until device deactivation.  We need to renew/rebind the DHCP address
			after the T1 (renew) and T2 (rebind) times have expired.
		- Increase some timeouts after bringing wireless cards up/down

2004-11-17  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* Cache access point MAC addresses in NetworkManagerInfo after you've explicitly
		connected to them.  Then, after a scan, match up non-ESSID-broadcasting access
		points with any cached MAC addresses from NetworkManagerInfo.  Allows us to
		show known access points that don't broadcast their ESSID in the menus without
		any user intervention whatsoever.

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
		- (nmi_dbus_get_network_addresses, nmi_dbus_add_network_address): new functions
			for dbus method calls "getNetworkAddresses" and "addNetworkAddress"

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- Add a "user_addresses" data member to the NMAccessPoint structure
		- (nm_ap_get_user_addresses, nm_ap_set_user_addresses): new functions for accessing
			the user_addresses data member

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
		- (nm_ap_list_get_ap_by_address): check user_addresses list too, instead of just
			the AP's reported address
		- (nm_ap_list_update_network): grab the user_addresses list from NetworkManagerInfo

	* src/NetworkManagerDHCP.c
		- Increase DHCP timeout from 25s -> 30s

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- (nm_dbus_get_network_addresses, nm_dbus_add_network_address): have NMI get/set
			user addresses

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_set_wireless_config): bring down the interface, wait 4s, bring it up,
			wait 2s, then configure it.  Sometimes Prism54 cards will freeze up with
			"mgnt tx queue full", seemingly in response to NM controlling the card too much.
			So, we take the card down to clear it out.
		- (nm_device_do_normal_scan): Copy over AP ESSIDs from the allowed access point list
			too, since that's where the user_addresses are

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_state_modification_monitor): Tell NMI to add an AP's hardware address to
			that wireless networks' user_addresses list upon successful activation

2004-11-16  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- (nm_device_clear_activation_fail): new function

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_state_modification_monitor): clear the activation_failed flag on devices
			when we've dealt with the failure so the user doesn't get failure-dialog-spammed

2004-11-16  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activate_wireless): Unref best_ap upon success so we don't
			leak the structure, better updating of now_scanning status
		- (nm_device_wireless_network_exists): Rewrite for better/faster checking

2004-11-15  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	Major rework of link detection code.  We now use DHCP
	as part of the link detection which proves to be much more robust,
	and also supports Open System authentication for wireless networks.

	We no longer use external DHCP client programs.  Instead, we use 
	our own DHCP client, based on substantially reworked bits of 'dhcpcd'

		- Display an error dialog when the user tries to use an
			"Other wireless network" that's not found.

2004-10-15 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

		- Fix up corner cases in applet state, making it
			look more responsive.  Change state to "connecting" when
			the user is forcing a device too.

2004-10-15 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
		- (nm_ap_list_update_network): Disown AP after the list takes ownership

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_nm_set_active_device): Simplify the device setting logic

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c

			and active device and only when done talking to
			NetworkManager turn it over to the GUI thread.

2004-10-15 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- Add "artificial" get/set functions, set for APs that
			aren't discovered as part of a scan but instead
			discovered by force-setting the ESSID

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- (nm_device_wireless_network_exists): pass back whether
			or not the discovered AP was encrypted.  Also, try
			falling back to encrypted mode on the card if unencrypted
			association doesn't work
		- (nm_device_find_and_use_essid): If the network requested
			did in fact exists, but it wasn't in our scan list, add
			an "artificial" entry for it.  Some Cisco cards don't
			see non-ESSID-broadcasting APs in their scan but can still
			associate with them if you know the ESSID, this works around
			that behavior
		- (nm_device_do_normal_scan): Carry "artificial" APs over from scan
			to scan if the card is currently associated with that AP

			manner

	* src/NetworkManager.c

		- (nm_ap_set_essid): Allow NULL essids

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- More use of nm_ap_list_[un]lock ()

			network/essid, just return nothing.  Also skip over NULL
			essid access points in the list when searching
		- (nm_ap_list_get_ap_by_address): new function
		- (nm_ap_list_update_network): set the access point's key source to

		- (nm_dbus_nm_set_active_device): deal with random networks the user
			may specify.  This is mainly for access points that don't
			broadcast their essid.  So if the user tells us to associate with
			some random ESSID that's not in our access point list, we find
			out if the access point does in fact exist (by attempting association
			and then matching that access point's MAC address with the essid the
			user gave us) and then we switch to it.
		- (nm_dbus_devices_handle_request): don't add blank-essid access points

			device list as long as they have an AP MAC address we can use.
			Also send WirelessNetwork[Dis]Appeared signals for non-active
			devices too.  Lets the applet update more frequently.

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
		- Patch from: Robert Paskowitz
			- Update backend code for Gentoo

			to managed/Infrastructure mode as soon as possible

2004-10-12 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Force wireless cards into Infrastructure mode before we use them

2004-10-12 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* TODO
		- Remove bit about static IP address support

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.c
		- (nm_spawn_process): Add some error reporting

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activation_configure_ip): hook up to the static config
			routines in the backends

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- (nm_system_device_update_config_info): use shvar.c routines to
			parse the config file iformation, not our own
		- (nm_system_device_setup_static_ip4_config): new function, based
			heavily on 'ifup' script and 'ipcalc' tool code.  Set up a device
			with a static IP address and gateway

	* src/backends/shvar.[ch]
		- Parser (filched from initscripts package) for ifcfg-* files

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerSystem.h
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c

	  src/backends/NetworkManagerSlackware.c
		- Stub nm_system_device_update_config_info() and nm_system_device_setup_static_ip4_config()

2004-10-11 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* TODO
		- Remove bit about more robust AP diffing since I just implemented it

2004-10-11 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.c
		- (nm_ap_new, nm_ap_new_from_ap): Don't crash when we don't have
			enough RAM to allocate new AP structures, but return NULL instead

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- (nm_ap_list_is_empty): new function
		- (nm_ap_list_combine): new function, combine two access point lists
		- (nm_ap_list_copy_keys): new function, copy keys from one list

			nm_device_just_activated     -> nm_device_is_just_activated
			nm_device_activating         -> nm_device_is_activating
			nm_device_now_scanning       -> nm_device_is_scanning
		- Cache the last 4 scans so that the access point list is more stable.
			We combine the lastest two scans and use that as the AP list,
			and diff that combined list against the combination of the earliest
			two cached scans for the WirelessNetworkAppeared/Dissappeared signals

2004-10-08 John (J5) Palmieri <johnp@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NWManagerInfo.h
		- (struct NetworkManagerInfo): add shutdown_timeout GSource

	* info-daemon/NWManagerInfoDbus.c

			(Red Hat Bug #134895)

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- (nmwa_dbus_filter): changed exit to gtk_main_quit ()

	* info-daemon/NWManagerInfo.c
		- (main): Terminated the notification_icon_cmd array with a NULL

2004-10-08  Hendrik Brandt  <hebra@cvs.gnome.org>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added de (German).

2004-10-08 Dan Williams <dcbw@redaht.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Be a bit more robust about link checking, ie make sure that
			the WEP key we were given actually has some data in it

2004-10-08 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.c (main):
		- Initialize GError object to NULL

2004-10-08 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- Die if NetworkManagerInfo dies, since it manages our lifetime

2004-10-08 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.[ch]
	  info-dameon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.[ch]
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoPassphraseDialog.[ch]
		- Preserve original label text in the passphrase dialog so that
			it actually gets updated with the new network name the next
			time around.  Previously, we were overwriting it so you'd get
			the wrong network name to enter a key for
		- Add a "Key Type" combo to the passphrase dialog, user selects
			encryption key type now, type is stored in GConf too
		- Adjust NM<->NMI DBUS protocol to pass the key type back to NM too

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- Remove all the encyption method magic.  It's now set by the user
			and NetworkManager retrieves the type of encryption key from
			NetworkManagerInfo

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- Adjust to new way of setting encryption key and method
		- Pull encryption method down from NMI along with key

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Removed encryption method fallback magic as the method is now
			determined by the user.  This greatly simplifies the connection
			logic.
		- More robust connection/link logic.  Besides removing the encryption
			method fallback magic, check whether or not the card is receiving
			invalidly encrypted packets, which usually indicates that we have
			a bad WEP key set.
		- Don't blindly forge ahead when DHCP fails (still not completely fixed)

	* test/nminfotest.c
		- Test out new "Key Type" stuff in the NMI passphrase dialog

2004-10-07 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

		- Add a new status tag "scanning", which is set when there
			is no active network connection, but NetworkManager is
			looking for an access point to associate with

	* panel-applet/main.c
		- Cast the applet appropriately for gtk_widget_show_all ()

Mon Oct  4 12:55:41 2004  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

2004-10-04 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Add a slightly more robust method of determining if the WEP key
			is correct or not, by checking the WEP-discarded packet count
			on the card

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.c
		- (nmi_gconf_notify_callback): Fix GConf essid escaping, should
			un-escape values we pull out rather than escaping them

2004-09-15  John (J5) Palmieri <johnp@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.conf
		- Created a more robust security policy for the DBus service
			- everything is denied by default
			- root can own and send to the service
			- users logged in at the console can send to the service

2004-09-13  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_get_essid): use iw_get_basic_config() rather than

		- Add function to return signal strength % from a device and a raw quality struct

	* test/nmclienttest.c
		- Update for new signal strength changes

2004-09-11  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

		- Start using NetworkDevice/WirelessNetwork structures in more places
		- Update for unified device/network forcing in NetworkManager

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- some code consolidation

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_nm_set_active_device): "setActiveDevice" now takes either one

2004-09-11  Martin Willemoes Hansen  <mwh@sysrq.dk>

	* configure.in: Added Danish (da) to ALL_LINGUAS.

2004-09-09  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

		- Don't clear out the best_ap for wireless devices when the link goes
			down, that's done elsewhere
		- Kill any dhcp daemons when cancelling device activation since they
			may be stuck waiting for a DHCP address, and since we're cancelling
			activation we don't care about that anymore

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Make sure to unref the device we ref earlier (we refed it to make sure
			it stuck around during device activation and such)
		- If we were going to change the best device, but its activating currently
			(and therefore the change didn't occur due to the check earlier)
			we mark the state changed to we come back to it later when device
			activation has canceled and its no longer activating

	* src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
		- SIGKILL dhcp daemons rather than SIGTERM-ing them

2004-09-09  Bryan Clark  <clarkbw@cvs.gnome.org>

	(network_tray.sort_networks):

	Added support for having wireless always scanning

2004-09-09  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	NOTE: this commit changes the behavior of wireless devices in
	NetworkManager.  They are now up all the time, scanning all
	the time.  Only the active device has an IP address and routing
	information set up however.  Also, NetworkManager will no longer
	opportunistically switch wireless networks when a better one
	comes in range, it will remain associated with one wireless network
	until that one drops out.

		- (nm_device_set_link_active): clear out the best ap for
			wireless devices when the link is set to FALSE
		- Scan on all wireless cards, all the time
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): split out the wireless card
			link-waiting code to a separate function
		- Keep wireless cards up even if device activation fails
		- Don't update the "best" ap as much

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Don't update the best ap when checking if its frozen,
			let link checking clear out a frozen best ap for us

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- Scan on all wireless cards, all the time

	* src/NetworkManager.[ch]
		- Break out routine that get the net.interface property from HAL,
			removing that logic from nm_create_device_and_add_to_list()
		- (nm_create_device_and_add_to_list): make this a bit more general so
			it doesn't do the talking to HAL.  Also add arguments to facilitate
			the create of test devices.
		- (nm_data_mark_state_changed): rename from nm_data_set_state_modified()
		- (nm_data_new, main, nm_print_usage): add new argument "--enable-test-devices"
			which makes NetworkManager listen for dbus commands to create test

			_cannot_ be created unless NM is started with --enable-test-devices.

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- New "getLinkActive" method for devices
		- New "setLinkActive" method for devices (only works on test devices)
		- New "createTestDevice" method on NetworkManager object to create a test
			device of a specified type (ie wired, wireless).  UDI is created from
			scratch, as is the interface name.  Only works when NM is started with
			--enable-test-devices switch.
		- New "removeTestDevice" method on NetworkManager object which removes a
			test device.  Only works when NM is started with --enable-test-devices

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Logic to facilitate test devices.  Add variables to NMDevice struct to indicate
			whether a device is a test device or not, and what its link status is.
		- Deal with test devices in most functions.  For those that work directly on hardware
			special-case test devices.
		- (nm_device_new): don't create a test device if test devices weren't enabled on the
			command-line.
		- (nm_device_update_link_active): split out logic for wired and wireless device link
			checking to separate functions to facilitate test device link checking.
		- (nm_device_set_enc_key): Since some drivers for wireless cards are daft and
			don't make a distinction between System Authentication and Encryption
			(namely Cisco aironet), we use Open System auth when setting a WEP key
			on the card.  We don't deal with Shared Key auth yet.
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): split the activation cancel check logic out into
			a separate routine nm_device_activation_cancel_if_needed()
		- (nm_device_activation_signal_cancel): rename from nm_device_activation_cancel()
		- (nm_device_fake_ap_list): Test wireless devices obviously cannot scan, so create
			a list of fake access points that they can "see"
		- (nm_device_is_test_device): return whether or not a device is a test device

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- (nm_policy_get_best_device): attempt to deal with wireless network selection,
			previously if you "locked"/forced NM to use a wireless device but then
			selected a wireless network for NM to use, it would switch to a wired device.
			So, if the active device is wireless and it has a "forced" best AP, use it
			if the "forced" best AP is still valid
		- (nm_state_modification_monitor): deal with NULL best devices, for example
			there were no usable network devices, or the last one was removed

	* src/backends/NetworkManager*.c
		- Deal with test devices, mostly just return success for operations like getting
			a DHCP address

	* test/nmtestdevices.c
		- Test tool to create/remove/link-switch test devices

2004-08-30  Bryan Clark  <clarkbw@cvs.gnome.org>

	* examples/python/NetworkManager.py: 
	added convience functions has_wired_device and has_wireless_device

	* examples/python/systray/network_tray.py: 
	cleaned up a bunch of cruft, added support for listing wireless
	networks just like the real applet.  This is probably all I'm
	going to work on this applet from now on.
	TODO: add support for actually changing networks and devices

	* examples/python/NetworkManager.py (NetworkManager.get_device): 
	changed "nm.networks" into a dict from a list so I can store all
	the cool information about networks in there

	* examples/python/systray/network_tray.py: 
	Added nice message when you try to run without running make first

	* examples/python/NetworkManager.py: 
	Bug fixes to the code so we get all the device information
	that we need in get_device()
	
	* examples/python/NMTester.py: 
	Fixed _print_device_list to print_device_list

2004-08-29  Colin Walters  <walters@verbum.org>

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c (nm_dbus_get_network_timestamp): Return

		- Remove debugging code
		- Enable device switching from menus

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- Method for asking NM to switch devices

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Set dev->activating earlier, avoids race between
			the dbus signal of "DeviceActivating" and setting
			dev->activating (which is what NM's "status" method call
			looks at)

Thu Aug 26 2004 Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Rework menu code to add devices to menu, and to show
			signal strength for each access point.  Code cleanups
			too.

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- Grab network devices from NetworkManager too
		- Grab quality information from NM for wireless networks

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- Add dbus methods for getting the HAL UDI from a device and
			for getting its base quality, if its wireless
		- Consolidate some functions (wireless network notifications,
			device notifications)
		- Add method for requesting NM to use a particular device

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Change for function consolidations from NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- Implement active device locking and user-requested devices
			(ie, tell NM to use a particular device instead of the one
			it autochose)

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Add method for getting the base quality of a device, if its
			wireless
		- Grab device base quailty info from iwlib during scans

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c

	Use a menu bar instead of a button for the main clickable
	thingy.
	
2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_set_enc_key): always set device to "open" mode instead of
			turning encryption off, because the Cisco driver doesn't associate
			with WEP-enabled access points unless we are in "open"

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- Don't try to defererence blank passphrases

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Rebuild the menu whenever a user clicks

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- (nmwa_udpate_state): Set panel icon to "wired" (for lack of better ones)
			when NM isn't around or when its not connected

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): Make sure to reset dev->activating if we get
			canceled.

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.c
		- (nmwa_dbus_get_bool, nmwa_dbus_get_network_encrypted): correct method name
			for getting encryption, and don't stop on "val" once we've gotten it
			from NetworkManager.  Short form:  encryption should now show up.

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Set ESSID on a gconf trusted network too when force-setting the wireless
			network to associate with

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/*
		- Rework the panel applet to do all DBUS communication in a separate
			thread

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.[ch]
		- Remove "get_next_priority" function

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.[ch]
		- Convert "priority" functions to "timestamp"

2004-08-25  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* src/NetworkManagerAP.[ch]
		- Add a "enc_method_good" member and accessors to an Access Point
			to signal when we've found the correct encryption method
			for an access point
		- Add a "timestamp" member and accessors, remove "priority" member
			and accessors (use timestamps instead)
		- Rename "wep_key"->"enc_key"
		- (nm_ap_get_enc_key_hashed): new, return the correct mangled key
			for a specified encryption method using the access points
			source encryption key/passphrase

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.c
		- When updating a network with dbus, grab timestamp now instead of
			priority

	* src/NetworkManagerDBus.[ch]
		- Add signal for "DeviceActivating"
		- Switch priority->timestamp

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- Change references of "wep_key" -> "enc_key" or "key"
		- Signal DeviceActivating when starting activation
		- When activating a wireless device, if the access point we are connecting
			to is encrypted, and we have a source key, try to generate a mangled
			key and use that (ie, generate real WEP key from a passphrase)
		- Rework device activation to fallback to other encryption methods if
			a previous one didn't work (ie, try mangling a key as a 104-bit passphrase
			first, then if that doesn't work fall back to direct hex key).
		- (nm_device_update_best_ap): fix a deadlock, and use timestamps instead of
			priority.  We now prefer the latest access point used, rather than using
			a priority scheme
		- (nm_device_do_normal_scan): make the encryption method "unknown" on access
			points we've just discovered, and merge in correct info from the global
			access point lists

2004-08-25  Seth Nickell  <seth@gnome.org>

        Patch from Matthew Garrett <mjg59@srcf.ucam.org> for adding

	(nm_system_device_stop_dhcp), (nm_system_device_flush_routes),
	(nm_system_device_flush_addresses), (nm_system_enable_loopback),
	(nm_system_delete_default_route),
	(nm_system_kill_all_dhcp_daemons), (nm_system_update_dns),
	(nm_system_load_device_modules):

	* src/NetworkManager.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerSystem.h
		- Implement preliminary Gentoo support, adding a
			nm_system_init function to the backend specification

	* configure.in

			distribution names

	* initscript/.cvsignore
	  initscript/Makefile.am
	  initscript/RedHat/Makefile.am
	  initscript/RedHat/NetworkManager
	  initscript/Gentoo/Makefile.am
	  initscript/Gentoo/NetworkManager
		- Refactored initscript code separately for each
			distribution

2004-08-23  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* configure.in
	  src/Makefile.am
	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
	  src/NetworkManager.c
	  src/NetworkManagerUtils.[ch]
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerSystem.h
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerRedHat.c
	  src/backends/NetworkManagerGentoo.c
		- Refactor system-specific code into separate backends for
			each distribution

2004-08-23  Dan Willemsen <dan@willemsen.us>

	* dispatcher-daemon/NetworkManagerDispatcher.c
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.[ch]
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c
	  info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoPassphraseDialog.c
	  src/NetworkManager.c

	  src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
	  src/NetworkManagerDevice.c

	  src/NetworkManagerWireless.c
		- Used syslog functions for logging instead of NM_DEBUG_DISPLAY & fprintf

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- Fixed usage wording for --no-daemon

2004-08-23  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c
		- Update our state every second to get more responsive panel icon
		- (nmwa_update_state): remove bogus applet->pix_state = PIX_WIRED that
			was causing our marching ants status blips to never move when
			looking for a wireless network

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activation_begin): return if activation has already begun
		- (nm_device_do_normal_scan): merge WEP key and priority from the
			trusted/preferred network into the device's access point when the
			scan list is processed

2004-08-23  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscript/NetworkManager
		- Use NMLaunchHelper rather than sleeping

	* initscript/NMLaunchHelper.c
	  Makefile.am
		- Add helper program that exits only when NM activates a device,
			or 10 seconds have passed, whichever happens first.  This
			stops the boot processes until we have a network connection,
			which NM can't do because it daemonizes and brings the connection
			up in the background.  Allows stuff like NFS to not die.

2004-08-20  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoPassphraseDialog.c
		- (nmi_passphrase_dialog_ok_clicked): when updating the wep key
			for a network, set the essid as well since it may not exist yet
		- (nmi_passphrase_dialog_init): don't star out the passphrase field,
			since WEP keys/passphrases are long and prone to entry-error

	* panel-applet/Makefile.am
	  panel-applet/wired.png
		- Add (pulled from system-config-network temporarily)

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Show wired picture when a wired connection is used
		- Rename wireless icon enums, adding WIRELESS

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_activate_wireless): unset encryption before bringing
			down the card and setting the essid
		- (nm_device_activatin_worker): request a key from the user if the
			AP we are connecting to is encrypted but we don't have a key
			for it yet
		- (nm_device_set_user_key_for_network): fix missing '== 0' for a
			strcmp() that prevented a user-entered key from actually getting
			used

2004-08-16  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* initscript/NetworkManager
		- Check for /sbin/ip
		- Do sysctl magic that network service does
		- sleep 4s after start to allow network time to come up [hack]

	* src/Makefile.am
	  src/NMLoadModules
		- Load all network device kernel modules (hal doesn't know devices
			are ethernet until the module is loaded, and therefore we don't know)

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- (main): daemonize later, launch NMLoadModules to alert HAL of our
			network devices, and bring up the loopback device explicitly

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.[ch]
		- (nm_enable_loopback): new function

2004-08-13  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* configure.in
	  panel-applet/Makefile.am
		- Fix up cleanfiles and server_DATA/server_in_files

	* README
		- Update with some comments on theory of operation

	* CONTRIBUTING
	  Makefile.am
		- Add CONTRIBUTING

2004-08-12  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/passphrase.glade
		- Set window title to " "

	* panel-applet/Makefile.am
	  panel-applet/keyring.png
		- Deliver to correct place

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Add comments
		- Remove applet->have_active_device as its no longer used
		- (nmwa_load_theme): load keyring.png too
		- (error_dialog): remove
		- (show_warning_dialog): subsume functionality of error dialog too
		- (nmwa_destroy, nmwa_new): create and dispose of an application-wide GConfClient
		- (nmwa_handle_network_choice): add to deal with user clicking on an item from
			the networks menu
		- (nmwa_menu_item_activated): GtkMenuItem "activate" signal handler
		- (nmwa_button_clicked, nmwa_setup_widgets): create and populate the menu on startup
			and when we get broadcasts of changed wireless access points only, not when the
			user clicks on the button to display the menu (too long of a wait)
		- (nmwa_add_menu_item): Make active network bold, and place a keyring icon beside
			networks that are encrypted
		- (nmwa_dispose_menu, nmwa_menu_item_data_free): dispose of the data we place on each
			menu item with g_object_set_data()

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- (nmwa_dbus_get_bool): add method to return boolean value from dbus message
		- (nmwa_dbus_get_active_network): add (nmwa_dbus_get_string() wrapper to get active network)
		- (nmwa_dbus_add_networks_to_menu): clean up, only show one instance of each ESSID in the menu
		- (nmwa_dbus_set_network): force NetworkManager to use a particular network for wireless cards
		- (nmwa_dbus_init, nmwa_dbus_filter): Trap network appear/disappear and device
			activation/deactivation signals and rebuild the menu when they happen

	* src/NetworkManager.c
		- (main): use new nm_spawn_process() rather than system()

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c
		- (nm_dbus_devices_handle_request): don't compare AP structure addresses directly, but essids
			instead.  Since we can now force best_aps to stick around, the AP structure to which
			dev->options.wireless.best_ap points to won't necessarily be in the device's device list
			if a scan has happened since the best_ap was frozen.  Also add "setNetwork" method
			to freeze the best_ap.

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- (nm_device_activation_worker): Use new nm_spawn_process() call rather than system()
		- (nm_device_*_best_ap): add freeze/unfreeze/get_frozen functions, and don't really update
			the best_ap in nm_device_update_best_ap() if the best_ap is frozen AND in the device's
			ap list

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.[ch]
		- (nm_spawn_process): add replacement for system() usage

2004-08-11  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.[ch]
		- Fix up copyright and credits to include Bastien and Eskil,
			who created the gnome-applets wireless applet, from whose
			skeleton this one was created
		- Rework nmwa_update_state()/nmwa_draw() so that state and which
			pixmap to draw is computed during nmwa_update_state()
		- Applet now shows itself all the time due to panel packing issues
			which caused the applet to previously never come back after hiding.
			When a wired device is the active device, the applet shows "not connected"

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessAppletDbus.[ch]
		- Clean up error messages and show what function they are from
		- nmwa_dbus_get_active_wireless_device()->nmwa_dbus_get_active_device()
		- Add new device type getters, and a status getter

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c

			network is actually in the device's ap list
		- (nm_dbus_nm_message_handler): Fix silly mistake returning status

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_device_update_best_ap): If the best AP is NULL, clear out the ESSID of the
			card

	* test/nmclienttest.c
		- Report status of NetworkManager too

2004-08-11  Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfo.c:
		- (main): clean up Seth's code style

	* info-daemon/NetworkManagerInfoDbus.c:
		- Use the more aptly-named path/service/interface constants from NetworkManager
		- Don't return empty strings ("") as object paths ever, instead return errors

	* panel-applet/NMWirelessApplet.c:
		- Clean up Seth's code style

	* src/NetworkManager.[ch]
		- (nm_remove_device_from_list): remove anything having to do with pending_device
		- (main, nm_print_usage): change --daemon=[yes|no] -> --no-daemon

	* src/NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]
		- Move Iter struct right above the iter functions to preserve opacity
		- (nm_ap_list_remove_ap): implement
		- (nm_ap_list_update_network): deal with errors returned from nm_dbus_get_network_priority(),
			remove AP if NetworkManagerInfo doesn't know anything about it
		- (nm_ap_list_diff): user NMAPList iterators
		- (nm_ap_list_print_members): implement debugging function

	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.[ch]
		- (nm_dbus_nm_get_active_device): remove anything to do with pending_device
		- (nm_dbus_get_user_key_for_network): remove DBusPendingCall stuff (unused),
			and move the actual key setting stuff into NetworkManagerDevice.c
		- (nm_dbus_get_network_priority): return -1 now on errors
		- (nm_dbus_nmi_filter): fix strcmp() error that caused PreferredNetworkUpdate signals to
			get lost, and force the active device to update its "best" ap when AP lists change
		- (nm_dbus_nm_message_handler): Update conditions for returning "connecting" for a "status"
			method call due to pending_device member removal

	* src/NetworkManagerDevice.[ch]
		- Move NMDevice structure to the top
		- Add a wireless scan mutex and a best_ap mutex to the Wireless Options structure
		- Remove Pending Action stuff from everywhere
		- (nm_device_activation_*): We now "begin" activation and start a thread to do the
			activation for us.  This thread blocks until all conditions for activation have
			been met (ie for wireless devices, we need a valid WEP key and a "best" ap), and
			then setup up the interface and runs dhclient.  We have to do this because there
			is no guaruntee how long dhclient takes, and while we are blocking on it, we cannot
			run our main loop and respond to dbus method calls or HAL device removals/inserts
		- (nm_device_set_user_key_for_network): Move logic here from NetworkManagerDbus.c so we
			can tell nm_device_activation_worker() that we've got a key
		- (nm_device_*_best_ap): lock access to best_ap member of Wireless Options structure
		- (nm_device_get_path_for_ap): dumb it down so the list doesn't lock against itself when
			diffing (AP appear/disappear signal functions make sure the AP is actually in the device's list)
		- (nm_device_update_best_ap): move logic from nm_wireless_is_ap_better() here

	* src/NetworkManagerPolicy.c
		- Remove anything to do with pending_device
		- Adjust device activation to deal with activation-in-worker-thread

	* src/NetworkManagerUtils.c
		- Clean up locking debugging a bit

	* src/NetworkManagerWireless.[ch]
		- (nm_wireless_is_ap_better): remove, stick logic in nm_device_update_best_ap().  This function
			was badly named and is better as a device function

	* panel-applet/.cvsignore: add

	Check if the NM service exists when initializing (rather than
	assuming it does not).
	
	* src/NetworkManagerDbus.c: (nm_dbus_init):

	Don't acquire the well-known service name until we have
	registered object/path handlers and can actually receive

		- Add missing <dbus/dbus.h> header
		- Move allowed_ap_list free functions to NetworkManagerAPList.[ch]

			logic is in device activation now
		- nm_device_activate(): for wireless devices, if we can't associate with access point (perhaps
			key is wrong) trigger get-user-key pending action
		- Implement get-user-key pending action stuff, tie to dbus messages
		- Rename nm_device_ap_list_get_ap() -> nm_device_ap_list_get_ap_by_index()
		- Add nm_device_ap_list_get_ap_by_essid()
		- Instead of copying "best" access points, ref them instead so that the key we set
