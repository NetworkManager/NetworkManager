        @connection: The connection to activate. If "/" is given, a valid device path must be given, and NetworkManager picks the best connection to activate for the given device. VPN connections must always pass a valid connection path.
        @device: The object path of device to be activated for physical connections. This parameter is ignored for VPN connections, because the specific_object (if provided) specifies the device to use.
        @specific_object: The path of a connection-type-specific object this activation should use. This parameter is currently ignored for wired and mobile broadband connections, and the value of "/" should be used (ie, no specific object). For WiFi connections, pass the object path of a specific AP from the card's scan list, or "/" to pick an AP automatically. For VPN connections, pass the object path of an ActiveConnection object that should serve as the "base" connection (to which the VPN connections lifetime will be tied), or pass "/" and NM will automatically use the current default device.

In addition to these domains, the following special domains can be used: [NONE, ALL, DEFAULT, DHCP, IP]. You can also specify that some domains should log at a different level from the default by appending a colon (':') and a log level (eg, 'WIFI:DEBUG').
