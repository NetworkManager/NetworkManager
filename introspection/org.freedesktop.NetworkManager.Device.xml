        Udi:

        Operating-system specific transient device hardware identifier. This is an
        opaque string representing the underlying hardware for the device, and
        shouldn't be used to keep track of individual devices. For some device
        types (Bluetooth, Modems) it is an identifier used by the hardware service
        (ie bluez or ModemManager) to refer to that device, and client programs
        use it get additional information from those services which NM does not
        provide. The Udi is not guaranteed to be consistent across reboots or
        hotplugs of the hardware. If you're looking for a way to uniquely track
        each device in your application, use the object path. If you're looking
        for a way to track a specific piece of hardware across reboot or hotplug,
        use a MAC address or USB serial number.

        Note that non-UTF-8 characters are backslash escaped. Use g_strcompress()
        to obtain the true (non-UTF-8) string.

        Reapply:
        @connection: The optional connection settings that will be reapplied on the device. If empty, the currently active settings-connection will be used. The connection cannot arbitrarly differ from the current applied-connection otherwise the call will fail. Only certain changes are supported, like adding or removing IP addresses.
        @version_id: If non-zero, the current version id of the applied-connection must match. The current version id can be retrieved via GetAppliedConnection. This optional argument allows to catch concurrent modifications between the GetAppliedConnection call and Reapply.
        @flags: Flags which would modify the behavior of the Reapply call. There are no flags defined currently and the users should use the value of 0.

        Attempts to update the configuration of a device without deactivating it.
        NetworkManager has the concept of connections, which are profiles that
        contain the configuration for a networking device. Those connections are
        exposed via D-Bus as individual objects that can be created, modified and
        deleted. When activating such a settings-connection on a device, the
        settings-connection is cloned to become an applied-connection and used to
        configure the device (see GetAppliedConnection). Subsequent modification
        of the settings-connection don't propagate automatically to the device's
        applied-connection (with exception of the firewall-zone and the metered
        property). For the changes to take effect, you can either re-activate the
        settings-connection, or call Reapply. The Reapply call allows you to
        directly update the applied-connection and reconfigure the device. Reapply
        can also be useful if the currently applied-connection is equal to the
        connection that is about to be reapplied. This allows to reconfigure the
        device and revert external changes like removing or adding an IP address
        (which NetworkManager doesn't revert automatically because it is assumed
        that the user made these changes intentionally outside of NetworkManager).
        Reapply can make the applied-connection different from the
        settings-connection, just like updating the settings-connection can make
        them different.

        GetAppliedConnection:
        @flags: Flags which would modify the behavior of the GetAppliedConnection call. There are no flags defined currently and the users should use the value of 0.
        @connection: The effective connection settings that the connection has currently applied.
        @version_id: The version-id of the currently applied connection. This can be specified during Reapply to avoid races where you first fetch the applied connection, modify it and try to reapply it. If the applied connection is modified in the meantime, the version_id gets incremented and Reapply will fail.

        Get the currently applied connection on the device. This is a snapshot of
        the last activated connection on the device, that is the configuration
        that is currently applied on the device. Usually this is the same as
        GetSettings of the referenced settings connection. However, it can differ
        if the settings connection was subsequently modified or the applied
        connection was modified by Reapply. The applied connection is set when
        activating a device or when calling Reapply.
