    <!--
        Update:
        @properties: New connection settings, properties, and (optionally) secrets.

        Update the connection with new settings and properties (replacing all
        previous settings and properties) and save the connection to disk. Secrets
        may be part of the update request, and will be either stored in persistent
        storage or sent to a Secret Agent for storage, depending on the flags
        associated with each secret.

        UpdateUnsaved:
        @properties: New connection settings, properties, and (optionally) secrets.

        Update the connection with new settings and properties (replacing all
        previous settings and properties) but do not immediately save the
        connection to disk. Secrets may be part of the update request and may sent
        to a Secret Agent for storage, depending on the flags associated with each
        secret. Use the 'Save' method to save these changes to disk. Note that
        unsaved changes will be lost if the connection is reloaded from disk
        (either automatically on file change or due to an explicit
        ReloadConnections call).

        Get the settings maps describing this network configuration. This will

        are often protected. Secrets must be requested separately using the

        Get the secrets belonging to this network configuration. Only secrets from
        persistent storage or a Secret Agent running in the requestor's session
        will be returned. The user will never be prompted for secrets as a result
        of this request.

    <!--
        Updated:

        Emitted when any settings or permissions change. When handling this

        the connection.

    <!--
        Update2:
        @settings: New connection settings, properties, and (optionally) secrets. Provide an empty array to use the current settings.
        @flags: Optional flags. Unknown flags cause the call to fail.
        @args: Optional arguments dictionary, for extentibility. Specifying unknown keys causes the call to fail.
        @result: Currently no results are returned.
        @since: 1.12

        Update the connection with new settings and properties (replacing all
        previous settings and properties).

        Update2 is an alternative to
        <link linkend="gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-NetworkManager-Settings-Connection.Update">Update</link>,
        <link linkend="gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-NetworkManager-Settings-Connection.UpdateUnsaved">UpdateUnsaved</link>
        and <link linkend="gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-NetworkManager-Settings-Connection.Save">Save</link>
        extensible with extra %flags and %args arguments.

        The %flags argument accepts the combination of following values,
        logically or-ed together:

        <varlistentry>

          <listitem><para>The change is only made in memory (without touching an eventual
          profile on disk). If neither 0x1 nor 0x2 is set, the change is made in memory

          to take effect on currently active devices.</para></listitem>

        </variablelist>

        The %args argument accepts the following keys:

        <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>plugin</literal>:</term>
          <listitem><para>The settings plugin the connection will be migrated to
          such as "keyfile" or "ifcfg-rh".</para>
          <para role="since">Since 1.38</para></listitem>
          <term><literal>version-id</literal>:</term>
          <listitem><para>If specified, the update request is rejected if the
          profile's version-id does not match. This can be used to catch concurrent
          modifications. Zero means no version check.</para><para role="since">Since 1.44</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        Secrets may be part of the update request, and will be either stored in persistent
        storage or sent to a Secret Agent for storage, depending on the flags
        associated with each secret.
