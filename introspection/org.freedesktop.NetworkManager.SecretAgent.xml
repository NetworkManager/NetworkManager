      org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.SecretAgent:
      @short_description: User Secret Agent

      Private D-Bus interface used by secret agents that store and provide
      secrets to NetworkManager. If an agent provides secrets to NetworkManager
      as part of connection creation, and the some of those secrets are "agent
      owned" the agent should store those secrets itself and should not expect
      its SaveSecrets() method to be called. SaveSecrets() will be called eg if
      some program other than the agent itself (like a connection editor)
      changes the secrets out of band. The agent should implement this D-Bus
      interface on an object with the path
      /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/SecretAgent.

        GetSecrets:
        @connection: Nested settings maps containing the connection for which secrets are being requested. This may contain system-owned secrets if the agent has successfully authenticated to modify system network settings and the GetSecrets request flags allow user interaction.
        @connection_path: Object path of the connection for which secrets are being requested.
        @setting_name: Setting name for which secrets are being requested.
        @hints: Array of strings of key names in the requested setting for which NetworkManager thinks a secrets may be required, and/or well-known identifiers and data that may be useful to the client in processing the secrets request. Note that it's not always possible to determine which secret is required, so in some cases no hints may be given. The Agent should return any secrets it has, or that it thinks are required, regardless of what hints NetworkManager sends in this request. Some hints have special prefixes that provide information to the agent; for example, VPN requests may send server-specific messages prefixed with "x-vpn-message:".
        @flags: (<link linkend="NMSecretAgentGetSecretsFlags">NMSecretAgentGetSecretsFlags</link>) Flags which modify the behavior of the secrets request. If true, new secrets are assumed to be invalid or incorrect, and the agent should ask the user for new secrets. If false, existing secrets should be retrieved from storage and returned without interrupting the user.
        @secrets: Nested settings maps containing secrets. Each setting MUST contain at least the 'name' field, containing the name of the setting, and one or more secrets.

        Retrieve and return stored secrets, if any, or request new secrets from
        the agent's user. If user interaction is allowed and the user enters new
        secrets, the agent is expected to save the new secrets to persistent
        storage (if the secret's flags include AGENT_OWNED) as NetworkManager will
        not send these secrets back to the same agent via a SaveSecrets() call. If
        the user canceled any interaction, the agent should return the
        UserCanceled error (see below).
