        does not start the network connection unless (1) device is idle and able
        to connect to the network described by the new connection, and (2) the

        AddConnection2:
        @settings: New connection settings, properties, and (optionally) secrets.
        @flags: optional flags argument. Currently the following flags are supported:
          "0x1" (to-disk),
          "0x2" (in-memory),
          "0x20" (block-autoconnect).
          Unknown flags cause the call to fail.
        @args: optional arguments dictionary, for extensibility. Currently no
          arguments are accepted. Specifying unknown keys causes the call
          to fail.
        @path: Object path of the new connection that was just added.
        @result: output argument, currently no additional results are returned.

        Add a new connection profile.

        Either the flags 0x1 (to-disk) or 0x2 (in-memory) must be specified.
        The effect is whether to behave like AddConnection or AddConnectionUnsaved.
        If 0x20 (block-autoconnect) is specified, autoconnect for the new profile
        is blocked from the beginnin. Otherwise, the profile might automatically
        connect if a suitable device is around.

        AddConnection2 is a extensible alternative to AddConnection, and AddConnectionUnsaved.
        The new variant can do everything that the older variants could, and more.

        @failures: Paths of connection files that could not be loaded.

        Loads or reloads the indicated connections from disk. You should call this
        after making changes directly to an on-disk connection file to make sure
        that NetworkManager sees the changes. (If "monitor-connection-files" in
        NetworkManager.conf is "true", then this will have no real effect, but is
        harmless.) As with AddConnection(), this operation does not necessarily
        start the network connection.

        Tells NetworkManager to reload all connection files from disk, including

        are re-read automatically any time they change, so you only need to use

        read while starting up, because NetworkManager's D-Bus service is only
        available after all connections have been read, and to prevent spamming
        listeners with too many signals at one time. To retrieve the initial
