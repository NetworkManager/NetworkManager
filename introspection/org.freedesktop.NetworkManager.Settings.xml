        AddConnection2:
        @settings: New connection settings, properties, and (optionally) secrets.
        @flags: Flags. Unknown flags cause the call to fail.
        @args: Optional arguments dictionary, for extentibility. Specifying unknown keys causes the call to fail.
        @path: Object path of the new connection that was just added.
        @result: Output argument, currently no additional results are returned.
        @since: 1.20

        Add a new connection profile.

        AddConnection2 is an alternative to
        <link linkend="gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-NetworkManager-Settings.AddConnection">AddConnection</link> and
        <link linkend="gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-NetworkManager-Settings.AddConnectionUnsaved">AddConnectionUnsaved</link>.
        The new variant can do everything that the older variants could, and more.
        Its behavior is extensible via extra %flags and %args arguments.

        The %flags argument accepts the combination of following values,
        logically or-ed together:

        <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>0x1 (to-disk)</literal>:</term>
          <listitem><para>The connection is persisted to disk.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>0x2 (in-memory)</literal>:</term>
          <listitem><para>The change is only made in memory (without touching an eventual
          profile on disk). If neither 0x1 nor 0x2 is set, the change is made in memory
          only, if the connection is already in memory only.</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>0x20 (block-autoconnect)</literal>:</term>
          <listitem><para>Blocks auto-connect on the new profile</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        The %args argument accepts the following keys:

        <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term><literal>plugin</literal>:</term>
          <listitem><para>The settings plugin the newly added connection will
          use, such as "keyfile" or "ifcfg-rh".</para>
          <para role="since">Since 1.38</para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        Either the flags 0x1 (to-disk) or 0x2 (in-memory) must be specified.
        The effect is whether to behave like
        <link linkend="gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-NetworkManager-Settings.AddConnection">AddConnection</link> or
        <link linkend="gdbus-method-org-freedesktop-NetworkManager-Settings.AddConnectionUnsaved">AddConnectionUnsaved</link>.

        LoadConnections:
        @filenames: Array of paths to on-disk connection profiles in directories monitored by NetworkManager.
        @status: Success or failure of the operation as a whole. True if NetworkManager at least tried to load the indicated connections, even if it did not succeed. False if an error occurred before trying to load the connections (eg, permission denied).
        @failures: Paths of connection files that could not be loaded.

        Loads or reloads the indicated connections from disk. You should call this
        after making changes directly to an on-disk connection file to make sure
        that NetworkManager sees the changes.
        As with AddConnection(), this operation does not necessarily
        start the network connection.

        Note that before 1.20, NetworkManager had a bug and this @status value was wrong.
        It is better to assume success if the method does not return with a D-Bus error.
        On top of that, you can look at @failures to know whether any of the requested files failed.

        available after all connections have been read, and to prevent spamming
        listeners with too many signals at one time. To retrieve the initial
        connection list, call the ListConnections() method once, and then listen
        for individual Settings.NewConnection and Settings.Connection.Deleted
