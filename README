c-siphash - Streaming-capable SipHash Implementation

ABOUT:
        The c-siphash project is a standalone implementation of SipHash in
        Standard ISO-C11. It provides a streaming-capable API to compute data
        hashes according to the SipHash algorithm.

        For API documentation, see the c-siphash.h header file, as well as the
        docbook comments for each function.

REQUIREMENTS:
        The requirements for c-siphash are:

            libc (e.g., glibc >= 2.16)

        At build-time, the following software is required:

            meson >= 0.41
