    <title>Description</title>
    <para>
      The <literal>NetworkManager-wait-online</literal> service is a <literal>oneshot</literal>
      systemd service that delays reaching the <literal>network-online</literal> target until
      NetworkManager reports that the startup is completed on the D-Bus.
    </para>
    <para>
      When the system boots, for example, remote mounts defined in <literal>/etc/fstab</literal>,
      require that the network is up. For this, these systemd units contain the
      <literal>After=network-online.target</literal> setting to order themselves after this
      target. <literal>NetworkManager-wait-online</literal> ensures that the
      <literal>network-online</literal> target is reached only after the network is available.
    </para>
    <para>
      Optimally, all services on the host react dynamically to network changes and systemd
      services do not need to be configured to start after reaching the
      <literal>network-online</literal> target. In this case,
      <literal>NetworkManager-wait-online.service</literal> has no effect and does not delay
      the boot time. On the other hand, if you encounter a long boot time due to the delay
      of <literal>NetworkManager-wait-online</literal>, investigate the services that require
      network access and fix them.
    </para>
    <para>
      Except for the time out value in the <literal>NetworkManager-wait-online.service</literal>
      unit, you cannot configure this service. Instead, settings in NetworkManager and the
      connection profiles affect the behavior:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Startup is not complete as long as NetworkManager profiles are in an activating
	  state. During boot, NetworkManager starts profiles with the
	  <literal>connection.autoconnect=yes</literal> setting. If activation fails,
	  NetworkManager retries the activation depending on the value of the
	  <literal>connection.autoconnect-retries</literal> setting.
        </para>
        <para>
          NetworkManager reports startup complete when all profiles and devices are either
	  activated or in a disconnect state and no further events are expected.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          When a device reaches the activate state depends on its configuration. For example,
	  with a profile that has both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled, by default, NetworkManager
	  considers the device as fully activated already when only one of the address
	  families is ready.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <literal>ipv4.may-fail</literal> and <literal>ipv6.may-fail</literal> settings
	  control this behavior. Additionally, the following settings influence when the
	  two address families complete: <literal>ipv4.required-timeout</literal>,
	  <literal>ipv6.required-timeout</literal>, <literal>ipv4.dhcp-timeout</literal>,
	  and <literal>ipv6.ra-timeout</literal>. For details, see
	  <link linkend='nm-settings-nmcli'><citerefentry><refentrytitle>nm-settings-nmcli</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry></link>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          NetworkManager cannot set IP addresses on bridge and bond devices that have ports
	  that do not auto-activate. Because of this configuration error,
	  <literal>NetworkManager-wait-online</literal> blocks until the service reaches
	  its timeout value.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Dispatcher scripts for the <literal>pre-up</literal> event run at a late stage
	  during activation of a profile. These scripts block the activation for when
	  NetworkManager considers the profile fully activated. For details, see
	  <link linkend='NetworkManager-dispatcher'><citerefentry><refentrytitle>NetworkManager-dispatcher</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry></link>.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The property <literal>connection.wait-activation-delay</literal> adds an additional
	  delay during activation and delays startup complete. This setting works around
	  certain cases where a device is known to not be ready for a certain amount of time.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The property <literal>connection.wait-device-timeout</literal> in the connection
	  profiles cause a delay until the waiting devices appear. This is useful if the
	  driver takes a longer time to detect the networking interfaces. This setting is
	  similar to the <literal>connection.gateway-ping-timeout</literal> property.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          With Wi-Fi devices, NetworkManager needs to wait for the first scan result to
	  know which networks are available. That adds a delay.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
         With Ethernet devices, NetworkManager waits for the carrier until the value in
	 <literal>[device*].carrier-wait-timeout</literal> is reached. This is because some
	 devices take a long time to detect the carrier. Consequently, booting with cable
	 unplugged, unnecessarily delays <literal>NetworkManager-wait-online.service</literal>.
