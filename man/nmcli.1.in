.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nmcli
is a command\(hyline tool for controlling NetworkManager and reporting network
status. It can be utilized as a replacement for \fInm\(hyapplet\fP or other
graphical clients. \fInmcli\fP is used to create, display, edit, delete, activate,
and deactivate network connections, as well as control and display network device
status.
.P
Typical uses include:
.IP \(em 4
Scripts: utilize NetworkManager via \fInmcli\fP instead of managing network
connections manually.  \fInmcli\fP supports a terse output format which is better
suited for script processing. Note that NetworkManager can also execute scripts,
called "dispatcher scripts", in response to network events. See
\fBNetworkManager\fP for details about these dispatcher scripts.
.IP \(em 4
Servers, headless machines, and terminals:  \fInmcli\fP can be used to control
NetworkManager without a GUI, including creating, editing, starting and stopping
network connections and viewing network status.
.SS \fIOPTIONS\fP
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-terse
Output is terse.  This mode is designed and suitable for computer (script)
processing.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pretty
Output is pretty. This causes \fInmcli\fP to produce easily readable outputs
for humans, i.e. values are aligned, headers are printed, etc.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mode tabular | multiline
Switch between \fItabular\fP and \fImultiline\fP output.
If omitted, default is \fItabular\fP for most commands. For the commands
producing more structured information, that cannot be displayed on a single
line, default is \fImultiline\fP. Currently, they are:
.br
.nf
  'nmcli connection show <ID>'
  'nmcli device show'
.fi
\fItabular\fP   \(en Output is a table where each line describes a single entry.
Columns define particular properties of the entry.
.br
\fImultiline\fP \(en Each entry comprises multiple lines, each property on its own
line. The values are prefixed with the property name.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-colors auto|yes|no
This option controls color output (using terminal escape sequences). \fIyes\fP
enables colors, \fIno\fP disables them, \fIauto\fP only produces colors when
standard output is directed to a terminal. The default value is \fIauto\fP.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fields <field1,field2,...> | all | common
This option is used to specify what fields (column names) should be printed.
Valid field names differ for specific commands. List available fields by
providing an invalid value to the \fI\-\-fields\fP option.
.br
\fIall\fP is used to print all valid field values of the command.
\fIcommon\fP is used to print common field values of the command.
If omitted, default is \fIcommon\fP.
The option is mandatory when \fI\-\-terse\fP is used.  In this case, generic
values \fIall\fP and \fIcommon\fP cannot be used.  (This is to maintain
compatibility when new fields are added in the future).
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-escape yes | no
Whether to escape ':' and '\\' characters in terse tabular mode.  The escape
character is '\\'.
If omitted, default is \fIyes\fP.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nocheck
This option can be used to force \fInmcli\fP to skip checking \fInmcli\fP and
\fINetworkManager\fP version compatibility. Use it with care, because using
incompatible versions may produce incorrect results.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-ask
When using this option \fInmcli\fP will stop and ask for any missing required
arguments, so do not use this option for non-interactive purposes like scripts.
This option controls, for example, whether you will be prompted for a password
if it is required for connecting to a network.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-wait <seconds>
This option sets a timeout period for which \fInmcli\fP will wait for \fINetworkManager\fP
to finish operations. It is especially useful for commands that may take a longer time to
complete, e.g. connection activation.
Specifying a value of \fB0\fP instructs \fInmcli\fP not to wait but to exit immediately
with a status of success. The default value depends on the executed command.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show \fInmcli\fP version.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print help information.
.SS \fIOBJECT\fP
.TP
.B general \- general \fINetworkManager\fP status and operations
.br
Use this object to show NetworkManager status and permissions. You can also get
and change system hostname, as well as NetworkManager logging level and domains.
.TP
.SS \fICOMMAND\fP := { status | hostname | permissions | logging }
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B status
.br
Show overall status of NetworkManager. This is the default action, when no additional
command is provided for \fIgeneral\fP object.
.TP
.B hostname [<hostname>]
.br
Get and change system hostname. With no arguments, this prints currently configured hostname.
When you pass a hostname, it will be handed over to NetworkManager to be set as a new system
hostname.
.br
Note that the term \fBsystem\fP hostname may also be referred to as \fBpersistent\fP or
\fBstatic\fP by other programs or tools. The hostname is stored in /etc/hostname
file in most distributions. For example, systemd-hostnamed service uses the term
\fBstatic\fP hostname and it only reads the /etc/hostname file when it starts.
.TP
.B permissions
.br
Show the permissions a caller has for various authenticated operations that
NetworkManager provides, like enable and disable networking, changing Wi\(hyFi
and WWAN state, modifying connections, etc.
.TP
.B logging [level <log level>] [domains <log domains>]
.br
Get and change \fINetworkManager\fP logging level and domains. Without any argument
current logging level and domains are shown. In order to change logging state, provide
\fIlevel\fP and, or, \fIdomain\fP parameters. See \fBNetworkManager.conf\fP for available
level and domain values.
.RE

.TP
.B networking \- get or set general networking state of NetworkManager
.br
Use this object to show NetworkManager networking status, or to enable and disable
networking. Disabling networking removes the configuration from all devices and
changes them to the 'unmanaged' state.
.TP
.SS \fICOMMAND\fP := { [ on | off | connectivity ] }
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B [ on | off ]
.br
Get networking\(hyenabled status or enable and disable networking by NetworkManager.
All interfaces managed by NetworkManager are deactivated when networking has
been disabled.
.TP
.B connectivity [check]
.br
Get network connectivity state.
The optional \fIcheck\fP argument tells NetworkManager to re-check the connectivity,
else the most recent known connectivity state is displayed without re-checking.
.br
Possible states are:
.RS
.PP
.IP \fInone\fP 9

are supplied, mobile broadband status is printed; \fIon\fP enables mobile broadband,
\fIoff\fP disables it.
.TP
.B all [ on | off ]
.br
Show or set all previously mentioned radio switches at the same time.
.RE

.TP
.B connection \- start, stop, and manage network connections
.sp
NetworkManager stores all network configuration as \fIconnections\fP, which are
collections of data (Layer2 details, IP addressing, etc.) that describe
how to create or connect to a network.  A connection is \fIactive\fP when
a device uses that connection's configuration to create or connect to a network.
There may be multiple connections that apply to a device, but only one of them
can be active on that device at any given time. The additional connections can
be used to allow quick switching between different networks and configurations.
.sp
Consider a machine which is usually connected to a DHCP-enabled network, but
sometimes connected to a testing network which uses static IP addressing.  Instead
of manually reconfiguring eth0 each time the network is changed, the settings can
be saved as two connections which both apply to eth0, one for DHCP (called
"default") and one with the static addressing details (called "testing").  When
connected to the DHCP-enabled network the user would run "nmcli con up default"
, and when connected to the static network the user would run "nmcli con up testing".
.TP
.SS \fICOMMAND\fP := { show | up | down | add | edit | modify | delete | reload | load }
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B show [--active]
.br
List in-memory and on-disk connection profiles, some of which may also be
active if a device is using that connection profile. Without a parameter, all
profiles are listed. When --active option is specified, only the active profiles
are shown.
.TP
.B show [--active] [--order <order spec>] [--show-secrets] [ id | uuid | path | apath ] <ID> ...
.br
Show details for specified connections. By default, both static configuration
and active connection data are displayed.  When --active option is specified,
only the active profiles are taken into account. When --show-secrets option is
specified, secrets associated with the profile will be revealed too.
.sp
Ordering:
.br
The --order option can be used to get custom ordering of connections. The
connections can be ordered by active status, name, type or D-Bus path. If
connections are equal according to a sort order category, an additional
category can be specified.
The default sorting order is equivalent to "--order active:name:path".
.sp
<order spec> := category:category:...
.br
categogy := [+-]active | [+-]name | [+-]type | [+-]path
.br
\fI+\fP or no prefix means sorting in ascending order (alphabetically or in numbers).
.br
\fI-\fP means reverse (descending) order.
.br
The category names can be abbreviated (e.g. --order -a:na)
.sp
\fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP, \fIpath\fP and \fIapath\fP keywords can be used if
\fI<ID>\fP is ambiguous.
.RS
.PP
Optional <ID>-specifying keywords are:
.IP \fIid\fP 13
\(en the <ID> denotes a connection name
.IP \fIuuid\fP 13
\(en the <ID> denotes a connection UUID
.IP \fIpath\fP 13
\(en the <ID> denotes a D-Bus static connection path
in the format of /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings/<num> or just <num>
.IP \fIapath\fP 13
\(en the <ID> denotes a D-Bus active connection path
in the format of /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/<num> or just <num>
.PP
It is possible to filter the output using the global \fI--fields\fP option. Use the following
values:
.RE
.RS
.PP
.IP \fIprofile\fP 13
\(en only shows static profile configuration
.IP \fIactive\fP 13
\(en only shows active connection data (when the profile is active)
.PP
You can also specify particular fields. For static configuration, use setting and property names
as described in \fInm-settings\fP(5) manual page. For active data use GENERAL, IP4, DHCP4, IP6,
DHCP6, VPN.
.PP
When no command is given to the \fIconnection\fP object, the default action
is 'nmcli connection show'.
.RE
.TP
.B up [ id | uuid | path ] <ID> [ifname <ifname>] [ap <BSSID>] [passwd <file with passwords>]
.RE
.RS
.B up ifname <ifname> [ap <BSSID>] [passwd <file with passwords>]
.RS
.br
Activate a connection.  The connection is identified by its name, UUID or D-Bus
path. If <ID> is ambiguous, a keyword \fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP or \fIpath\fP can be
used.  When requiring a particular device to activate the connection on, the
\fIifname\fP option with interface name should be given.  If the <ID> is not
given an \fIifname\fP is required, and NetworkManager will activate the best
available connection for the given \fIifname\fP.  In case of a VPN connection,
the \fIifname\fP option specifies the device of the base connection. The
\fIap\fP option specify what particular AP should be used in case of a Wi\(hyFi
connection.
.br
If '--wait' option is not specified, the default timeout will be 90 seconds.
.br
See \fBconnection show\fP above for the description of the <ID>-specifying keywords.
.RS
.PP
Available options are:
.IP \fIifname\fP 13
\(en interface that will be used for activation
.IP \fIap\fP 13
\(en BSSID of the AP which the command should connect to (for Wi\(hyFi connections)
.IP \fIpasswd-file\fP 13
\(en some networks may require credentials during activation. You can give these
credentials using this option.
Each line of the file should contain one password in the form of
.br
\fBsetting_name.property_name:the password\fP
.br
For example, for WPA Wi-Fi with PSK, the line would be
.br
\fI802-11-wireless-security.psk:secret12345\fP
.br
For 802.1X password, the line would be
.br
\fI802-1x.password:my 1X password\fP
.br
nmcli also accepts "wifi-sec" and "wifi" strings instead of "802-11-wireless-security".
When NetworkManager requires a password and it is not given, nmcli will ask for it
when run with --ask. If --ask was not passed, NetworkManager can ask another secret
agent that may be running (typically a GUI secret agent, such as nm-applet or
gnome-shell).
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B down [ id | uuid | path | apath ] <ID> ...
.br
Deactivate a connection from a device without preventing the device from
further auto-activation. Multiple connections can be passed to the command. 
.sp
Be aware that this command deactivates the specified active connection, but the device
on which the connection was active, is still ready to connect and will perform
auto-activation by looking for a suitable connection that has the 'autoconnect'
flag set. This includes the just deactivated connection. So if the connection is set
to auto-connect, it will be automatically started on the disconnected device again.
.br
In most cases you may want to use \fIdevice disconnect\fP command instead.
.sp
The connection is identified by its name, UUID or D-Bus path.
If <ID> is ambiguous, a keyword \fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP, \fIpath\fP or
\fIapath\fP can be used.
.br
See \fBconnection show\fP above for the description of the <ID>-specifying keywords.
.br
If '--wait' option is not specified, the default timeout will be 10 seconds.

.B edit [type <new connection type>] [con-name <new connection name>]  - add a new connection
.RS
Edit an existing connection or add a new one, using an interactive editor.
.br
The existing connection is identified by its name, UUID or D-Bus path.
If <ID> is ambiguous, a keyword \fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP, or \fIpath\fP can be used.
See \fBconnection show\fP above for the description of the <ID>-specifying keywords.
Not providing an <ID> means that a new connection will be added.

.B modify [--temporary] [ id | uuid | path ] <ID> [+|-]<setting>.<property> <value>
.B [+|-]<setting>.<property> <value> ...
.br
Modify one or more properties in the connection profile.
.br
The connection is identified by its name, UUID or D-Bus path. If <ID> is
ambiguous, a keyword \fIid\fP, \fIuuid\fP or \fIpath\fP can be used.  See
\fInm-settings\fP(5) for setting and property names, their descriptions and
default values. This command supports abbreviations for \fIsetting name\fP and
\fIproperty name\fP provided they are unique. Empty \fIvalue\fP ("") removes
the property value (sets the property to the default value).  The provided
value overwrites the existing property value.
.br
If you want to append an item to the existing value, use \fI+\fP prefix for the
property name. If you want to remove just one item from container-type
property, use \fI-\fP prefix for the property name and specify a value or an
zero-based index of the item to remove (or option name for properties with
named options) as \fIvalue\fP. Of course, \fI+|-\fP only have a real effect for
multi-value (container) properties like ipv4.dns, ipv4.addresses, bond.options,
etc.
.br
The changes to the connection profile will be saved persistently by
NetworkManager, unless \fI--temporary\fP option is provided, in which case the
changes won't persist over NetworkManager restart.
.TP
.B delete [ id | uuid | path ] <ID> ...
.br
Delete a configured connection. The connection to be deleted is identified by
its name, UUID or D-Bus path. If <ID> is ambiguous, a keyword \fIid\fP,
\fIuuid\fP or \fIpath\fP can be used.
.br
See \fBconnection show\fP above for the description of the <ID>-specifying keywords.
.br
If '--wait' option is not specified, the default timeout will be 10 seconds.
.TP
.B reload
.br
Reload all connection files from disk. \fINetworkManager\fP does not monitor
changes to connection files by default. So you need to use this command in order
to tell \fINetworkManager\fP to re-read the connection profiles from disk when
a change was made to them. However, the auto-loading feature can be enabled and
then \fINetworkManager\fP will reload connection files any time they change
(monitor-connection-files=true in \fINetworkManager.conf\fP(5)).
.TP
.B load <filename> [<filename>...]
.br
Load/reload one or more connection files from disk. Use this after manually
editing a connection file to ensure that \fBNetworkManager\fP is aware
of its latest state.

Print status of devices.
.br
This is the default action if no command is specified to \fIdevice\fP object.
.TP
.B show [<ifname>]
.br
Show detailed information about devices.  Without an argument, all devices are
examined. To get information for a specific device, the interface name has
to be provided.
.TP
.TP
.B set [ifname] <ifname> [autoconnect yes|no] [managed yes|no]
.br
Set device properties.
.TP
.B connect <ifname>
.br
Connect the device. NetworkManager will try to find a suitable connection that
will be activated. It will also consider connections that are not set to auto connect.
.br
If '--wait' option is not specified, the default timeout will be 90 seconds.
.TP
.B disconnect <ifname> ...
.br
Disconnect a device and prevent the device from automatically activating further
connections without user/manual intervention. Note that disconnecting software
devices may mean that the devices will disappear.
.br
If '--wait' option is not specified, the default timeout will be 10 seconds.
.TP
.B delete <ifname> ...
.br
Delete a device. The command removes the interface from the system. Note that

respectively.
.TP
.B wifi connect <(B)SSID> [password <password>] [wep\-key\-type key|phrase] [ifname <ifname>] [bssid <BSSID>] [name <name>]
.B [private yes|no] [hidden yes|no]
.br
Connect to a Wi\(hyFi network specified by SSID or BSSID. The command creates a new
connection and then activates it on a device. This is a command\(hyline counterpart
of clicking an SSID in a GUI client. The command always creates a new connection
and thus it is mainly useful for connecting to new Wi\(hyFi networks. If a connection
for the network already exists, it is better to bring up (activate) the existing connection
as follows: \fInmcli con up id <name>\fP. Note that only open, WEP and WPA\(hyPSK networks
are supported at the moment. It is also supposed that IP configuration is obtained via
DHCP.

.B wifi rescan [ifname <ifname>] [[ssid <SSID>] ...]
.br
Request that \fINetworkManager\fP immediately re-scan for available access points.
NetworkManager scans Wi\(hyFi networks periodically, but in some cases it can be
useful to start scanning manually (e.g. after resuming the computer). By using
\fIssid\fP, it is possible to scan for a specific SSID, which is useful for APs
with hidden SSIDs. You can provide multiple \fIssid\fP parameters in order to
scan more SSIDs.

This command does not show the APs, use 'nmcli device wifi list' for that.

.B secret
.br
Register nmcli as a NetworkManager secret agent and listen for secret requests.
You do usually not need this command, because nmcli can handle secrets when
connecting to networks. However, you may find the command useful when you use
another tool for activating connections and you do not have a secret agent
available (like nm-applet).
.TP
.B polkit
.br
Register nmcli as a polkit agent for the user session and listen for
authorization requests. You do not usually need this command, because nmcli can
handle polkit actions related to NetworkManager operations (when run with
--ask).  However, you may find the command useful when you want to run a simple
text based polkit agent and you do not have an agent of a desktop environment.
Note that running this command makes nmcli handle all polkit requests, not only
NetworkManager related ones, because only one polkit agent can run for the
session.
.TP
.B all

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
\fInmcli\fP's behavior is affected by the following environment variables.
.IP "LC_ALL" 13
If set to a non\(hyempty string value, it overrides the values of all the other
internationalization variables.
.IP "LC_MESSAGES" 13
Determines the locale to be used for internationalized messages.
.IP "LANG" 13
Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset
or null.

.RE
Internationalization notes:
.br
Be aware that \fInmcli\fP is localized and that is why the output depends on
your environment. This is important to realize especially when you parse the
output.
.br
Call \fInmcli\fP as \fBLC_ALL=C nmcli\fP to be sure the locale is
set to "C" while executing in a script.

\fBLC_ALL\fP, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fP, \fBLANG\fP variables specify the LC_MESSAGES
locale category (in that order), which determines the language that \fInmcli\fP
uses for messages.  The "C" locale is used if none of these variables are set,
and this locale uses English messages.

.SH EXIT STATUS
\fInmcli\fP exits with status 0 if it succeeds, a value greater than 0 is
returned if an error occurs.
.IP "0" 4
Success \(en indicates the operation succeeded
.IP "1" 4
