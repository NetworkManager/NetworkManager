.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nmcli
is a command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager and getting its status.
It is not meant as a replacement of \fInm-applet\fP or other similar clients.
Rather it's a complementary utility to these programs.
The main \fInmcli\fP's usage is on servers, headless machines or just for
power users who prefer the command line.
.P
The use cases comprise:
.IP \(em 4
Initscripts: ifup/ifdown can utilize NetworkManager via \fInmcli\fP instead of
having to manage connections itself and possibly interfere with NetworkManager.
.IP \(em 4
Servers, headless machines: No GUI is available; then \fInmcli\fP can be used
to activate/deactivate connections.  However, if a connection requires a secret
to activate and if that secret is not stored at the system level, \fInmcli\fP
will not be able to activate it; it is currently unable to supply the needed
secrets to NetworkManager.
.IP \(em 4
User sessions: \fInmcli\fP can be used activate/deactivate connections from the
command line, but a full NetworkManager client (like \fInm-applet\fP) is used
for supplying secrets not stored at the system level.  Keyring dialogs and
password prompts may appear if this happens.
.SS \fIOPTIONS\fP
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-terse
Output is terse.  This mode is designed and suitable for computer (script)
processing.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-pretty
Output is pretty.  This causes \fInmcli\fP to produce easy readable outputs
for humans, i.e. values are aligned, headers are printed, etc.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mode tabular | multiline
Switch between \fItabular\fP and \fImultiline\fP output.
If omitted, default is \fItabular\fP for most commands.  For the commands
producing more structured information, that cannot be displayed on a single
line, default is \fImultiline\fP. Currenly, they are:
.br
.nf
  'nmcli con list id|uuid <name>'
  'nmcli dev list'
.fi
\fItabular\fP   - Output is a table where each line describes a single entry.
Columns define particular properties of the entry.
.br
\fImultiline\fP - Each entry comprises more lines, each property on its own line.
The values are prefixed with the property name.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fields <field1,field2,...> | all | common
This option is used to specify what fields (column names) should be printed.
Valid field names differ for specific commands. List available fields by
providing an invalid value to the \fI--fields\fP option.
.br
\fIall\fP is used to print all valid field values of the command.
\fIcommon\fP is used to print common field values of the command.
If omitted, default is \fIcommon\fP.
The option is mandatory when \fI--terse\fP is used.  In this case, generic
values \fIall\fP and \fIcommon\fP cannot be used.  (This is to maintain
compatibility when new fields are added in the future).
.TP
.B \-e, \-\-escape yes | no
Whether to escape ':' and '\\' characters in terse tabular mode.  The escape
character is '\\'.
If omitted, default is \fIyes\fP.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show \fInmcli\fP version.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print help information.
.SS \fIOBJECT\fP
.TP
.B nm
NetworkManager
.br
Use this object to inquire and change state of NetworkManager.
.TP
.SS \fICOMMAND\fP := { status | enable | sleep | wifi | wwan }
.sp
.RS
.TP
.B status
.br
Show overall status of NetworkManager.  This is the default action, when no
command is provided to \fInm\fP object.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.

interface: org.freedesktop.NetworkManager
method:    Enable
arguments: TRUE or FALSE
.fi
.TP
.B sleep [true|false]
.br
Get sleep status or put to sleep/awake NetworkManager.  All interfaces managed by NetworkManager
are deactivated when it falls asleep.  This command is not meant for user to enable/disable
networking, use \fIenable\fP for that.  D-Bus \fISleep\fP method is designed
to put NetworkManager to sleep or awake for suspending/resuming computer.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
interface: org.freedesktop.NetworkManager
method:    Sleep
arguments: TRUE or FALSE

.br
Inquire or set status of WiFi in NetworkManager.  Without any further argument,
WiFi status is printed; \fIon\fP enables WiFi; \fIoff\fP disables WiFi.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.
.fi
.TP
.B wwan [on|off]
.br
Inquire or set status of WWAN in NetworkManager.  Without any further argument,
WWAN status is printed; \fIon\fP enables WWAN; \fIoff\fP disables WWAN.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.

.sp
.RS
.TP
.B list [id <id> | uuid <id>]
.br
List configured connections.  Without a parameter, all connections
are listed.  In order to get connection details, \fIid\fP with connection's
name or \fIuuid\fP with connection's UUID shall be specified.  When no command
is given to the \fIcon\fP object, the default action is 'nmcli con list'.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.
.fi
.TP
.B status
.br
Print status of active connections.
.br
.nf
\fBReference to D-Bus:\fP
No simple reference.
.fi
.TP
.B up id <id> | uuid <id> [iface <iface>] [ap <hwaddr>] [\-\-nowait] [\-\-timeout <timeout>]
.br
Activate a connection.  The connection is identified by its name using \fIid\fP
or UUID using \fIuuid\fP.  For requiring particular device to activate
the connection on, \fIiface\fP option with interface name should be given.
\fIap\fP option can further concretize what AP should be used in case of WiFi
connection.  \fI\-\-nowait\fP option causes \fInmcli\fP to exit immediately and
not to wait for command completion.  \fI\-\-timeout\fP option provides a means
to specify how long to wait for operation completion.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
\fInmcli\fP's behavior is affected by the following environment variables.
.IP "LC_ALL" 13
If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other
internationalization variables.
.IP "LC_MESSAGES" 13
Determines the locale to be used for internationalised messages.
.IP "LANG" 13
Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset
or null.

.RE
Notes about localization:
.br
Be aware that \fInmcli\fP is localized and that's why the output depends on 
your environment. It's important to realize that especially when you parse the
output.
.br
Call \fInmcli\fP as \fBLC_ALL=C nmcli\fP to be sure the locale is
set to "C" while executing in a script.

\fBLC_ALL\fP, \fBLC_MESSAGES\fP, \fBLANG\fP variables specify the LC_MESSAGES
locale category (in that order), which determines the language that \fInmcli\fP
uses for messages.  The "C" locale is used if none of these variables are set,
and this locale uses English messages.

.SH EXIT STATUS
\fInmcli\fP exits with status 0 if it succeeds, a value greater than 0 is returned if errors occur.
.IP "0" 4
Success - indicates the operation succeeded
.IP "1" 4
Unknown or unspecified error
.IP "2" 4
Invalid user input, wrong \fInmcli\fP invocation
.IP "3" 4
Timeout expired (see commands with \fI\-\-timeout\fP option)
.IP "4" 4
Connection activation failed
.IP "5" 4
Connection deactivation failed
.IP "6" 4
Disconnecting device failed
