    <title>Description</title>
    <para><literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal> is the configuration file for NetworkManager. It is used
    to set up various aspects of NetworkManager's behavior. The
    location of the main file and configuration directories may be changed
    through use of the <option>--config</option>, <option>--config-dir</option>,
    <option>--system-config-dir</option>, and <option>--intern-config</option>
    argument for NetworkManager, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>If a default <literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal> is
    provided by your distribution's packages, you should not modify
    it, since your changes may get overwritten by package
    updates. Instead, you can add additional <literal>.conf</literal>
    files to the <literal>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d</literal> directory.
    These will be read in order, with later files overriding earlier ones.
    Packages might install further configuration snippets to <literal>/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d</literal>.
    This directory is parsed first, even before <literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal>.
    The loading of a file <literal>/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/<replaceable>name</replaceable>.conf</literal>
    can be prevented by adding a file <literal>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/<replaceable>name</replaceable>.conf</literal>.
    In this case, the file from the etc configuration shadows the file from the
    system configuration directory.
    </para>
    <para>
    NetworkManager can overwrite certain user configuration options via D-Bus or other internal
    operations. In this case it writes those changes to <literal>/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf</literal>.
    This file is not intended to be modified by the user, but it is read last and can shadow
    user configuration from <literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal>.
    </para>

  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>File Format</title>
    <para>
      The configuration file format is so-called key file (sort of
      ini-style format).  It consists of sections (groups) of
      key-value pairs. Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are
      considered comments. Sections are started by a header line
      containing the section enclosed in '[' and ']', and ended
      implicitly by the start of the next section or the end of the
      file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.
    </para>
    <para>
      For keys that take a list of devices as their value, you can
      specify devices by their MAC addresses or interface names, or
      "*" to specify all devices. See <xref linkend="device-spec"/>
      below.
    </para>
    <para>
      Minimal system settings configuration file looks like this:
      <programlisting>
	[main]
	plugins=keyfile
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      As an extension to the normal keyfile format, you can also
      append a value to a previously-set list-valued key by doing:
      <programlisting>
	plugins+=another-plugin
	plugins-=remove-me
      </programlisting>
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title><literal>main</literal> section</title>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term><varname>plugins</varname></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Lists system settings plugin names separated by ','. These
	    plugins are used to read and write system-wide
	    connections. When multiple plugins are specified, the
	    connections are read from all listed plugins. When writing
	    connections, the plugins will be asked to save the
	    connection in the order listed here; if the first plugin
	    cannot write out that connection type (or can't write out
	    any connections) the next plugin is tried, etc. If none of
	    the plugins can save the connection, an error is returned
	    to the user.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If NetworkManager defines a distro-specific
	    network-configuration plugin for your system, then that
	    will normally be listed here. (See below for the available
	    plugins.) Note that the <literal>keyfile</literal> plugin
	    is always appended to the end of this list (if it doesn't
	    already appear earlier in the list), so if there is no
	    distro-specific plugin for your system then you can leave
	    this key unset and NetworkManager will fall back to using
	    <literal>keyfile</literal>.

	wired connection for any Ethernet device that is managed and
	doesn't have a connection configured. List a device in this

      <varlistentry>
	<term><varname>ignore-carrier</varname></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Specify devices for which NetworkManager will (partially)
	    ignore the carrier state. Normally, for
	    device types that support carrier-detect, such as Ethernet
	    and InfiniBand, NetworkManager will only allow a
	    connection to be activated on the device if carrier is
	    present (ie, a cable is plugged in), and it will
	    deactivate the device if carrier drops for more than a few
	    seconds.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Listing a device here will allow activating connections on
	    that device even when it does not have carrier, provided
	    that the connection uses only statically-configured IP
	    addresses. Additionally, it will allow any active
	    connection (whether static or dynamic) to remain active on
	    the device when carrier is lost.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Note that the "carrier" property of NMDevices and device D-Bus
	    interfaces will still reflect the actual device state; it's just
	    that NetworkManager will not make use of that information.

      <varlistentry>
	<term><varname>configure-and-quit</varname></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    When set to '<literal>true</literal>', NetworkManager quits after
	    performing initial network configuration but spawns small helpers
	    to preserve DHCP leases and IPv6 addresses.  This is useful in
	    environments where network setup is more or less static or it is
	    desirable to save process time but still handle some dynamic
	    configurations.  When this option is <literal>true</literal>,
	    network configuration for WiFi, WWAN, Bluetooth, ADSL, and PPPoE
	    interfaces cannot be preserved due to their use of external
	    services, and these devices will be deconfigured when NetworkManager
	    quits even though other interface's configuration may be preserved.
	    Also, to preserve DHCP addresses the '<literal>dhcp</literal>' option
	    must be set to '<literal>internal</literal>'. The default value of
	    the '<literal>configure-and-quit</literal>' option is
	    '<literal>false</literal>', meaning that NetworkManager will continue
	    running after initial network configuration and continue responding
	    to system and hardware events, D-Bus requests, and user commands.

        the requested value is found.
        In the example above, "ipv4.route-metric" for wlan0 interface is set to 50,
        and for all other Wi-Fi typed interfaces to 55. Also, Wi-Fi devices would have
        IPv6 private addresses enabled by default, but other devices would have it disabled.
        Note that also "wlan0" gets "ipv6.ip6-privacy=1", because although the section
        "[connection-wifi-wlan0]" matches the device, it does not contain that property
        and the search continues.

        When having different sections in multiple files, sections from files that are read
        later have higher priority. So within one file the priority of the sections is
        top-to-bottom. Across multiple files later definitions take precedence.
