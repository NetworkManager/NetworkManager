    <title>Description</title>
    <para><literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal> is the configuration file for NetworkManager. It is used
    to set up various aspects of NetworkManager's behavior. The
    location of the main file and configuration directories may be changed
    through use of the <option>--config</option>, <option>--config-dir</option>,
    <option>--system-config-dir</option>, and <option>--intern-config</option>
    argument for NetworkManager, respectively.
    </para>
    <para>If a default <literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal> is
    provided by your distribution's packages, you should not modify
    it, since your changes may get overwritten by package
    updates. Instead, you can add additional <literal>.conf</literal>
    files to the <literal>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d</literal> directory.
    These will be read in order, with later files overriding earlier ones.
    Packages might install further configuration snippets to <literal>/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d</literal>.
    This directory is parsed first, even before <literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal>.
    Scripts can also put per-boot configuration into <literal>/run/NetworkManager/conf.d</literal>.
    This directory is parsed second, also before <literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal>.
    The loading of a file <literal>/run/NetworkManager/conf.d/<replaceable>name</replaceable>.conf</literal>
    can be prevented by adding a file <literal>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/<replaceable>name</replaceable>.conf</literal>.
    Likewise, a file <literal>/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/<replaceable>name</replaceable>.conf</literal>
    can be shadowed by putting a file of the same name to either <literal>/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d</literal>
    or <literal>/run/NetworkManager/conf.d</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
    NetworkManager can overwrite certain user configuration options via D-Bus or other internal
    operations. In this case it writes those changes to <literal>/var/lib/NetworkManager/NetworkManager-intern.conf</literal>.
    This file is not intended to be modified by the user, but it is read last and can shadow
    user configuration from <literal>NetworkManager.conf</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
    Certain settings from the configuration can be reloaded at runtime either by sending SIGHUP signal or via
    D-Bus' Reload call.
    </para>

    <title>File Format</title>
    <para>
      The configuration file format is so-called key file (sort of
      ini-style format).  It consists of sections (groups) of
      key-value pairs. Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are
      considered comments. Sections are started by a header line
      containing the section enclosed in '[' and ']', and ended
      implicitly by the start of the next section or the end of the
      file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a section.
    </para>
    <para>
      For keys that take a list of devices as their value, you can
      specify devices by their MAC addresses or interface names, or
      "*" to specify all devices. See <xref linkend="device-spec"/>
      below.
    </para>
    <para>
      Minimal system settings configuration file looks like this:
      <programlisting>
[main]
plugins=keyfile
</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      As an extension to the normal keyfile format, you can also
      append a value to a previously-set list-valued key by doing:
      <programlisting>
plugins+=another-plugin
plugins-=remove-me
</programlisting>
    </para>
  </refsect1>

        <listitem>
          <para>
            Lists system settings plugin names separated by ','. These
            plugins are used to read and write system-wide
            connection profiles. When multiple plugins are specified, the
            connections are read from all listed plugins. When writing
            connections, the plugins will be asked to save the
            connection in the order listed here; if the first plugin
            cannot write out that connection type (or can't write out
            any connections) the next plugin is tried, etc. If none of
            the plugins can save the connection, an error is returned
            to the user.

            The default value and the number of available plugins is
            distro-specific. See <xref linkend="settings-plugins"/>
            below for the available plugins.
            Note that NetworkManager's native <literal>keyfile</literal>
            plugin is always appended to the end of this list (if it doesn't
            already appear earlier in the list).

          <para>
            When set to '<literal>true</literal>', NetworkManager quits after
            performing initial network configuration but spawns small helpers
            to preserve DHCP leases and IPv6 addresses.  This is useful in
            environments where network setup is more or less static or it is
            desirable to save process time but still handle some dynamic
            configurations.  When this option is <literal>true</literal>,
            network configuration for Wi-Fi, WWAN, Bluetooth, ADSL, and PPPoE
            interfaces cannot be preserved due to their use of external
            services, and these devices will be deconfigured when NetworkManager
            quits even though other interface's configuration may be preserved.
            Also, to preserve DHCP addresses the '<literal>dhcp</literal>' option
            must be set to '<literal>internal</literal>'. The default value of
            the '<literal>configure-and-quit</literal>' option is
            '<literal>false</literal>', meaning that NetworkManager will continue
            running after initial network configuration and continue responding
            to system and hardware events, D-Bus requests, and user commands.

            Set the management mode of the hostname. This parameter will
            affect only the transient hostname. If a valid static hostname is set,
            NetworkManager will skip the update of the hostname despite the value of
            this option. An hostname empty or equal to 'localhost', 'localhost6',
            'localhost.localdomain' or 'localhost6.localdomain' is considered invalid.
          </para>
          <para><literal>default</literal>: NetworkManager will update the hostname
          with the one provided via DHCP on the main connection (the one with a default

          outside NetworkManager. If it is not valid, NetworkManager will try to recover
          the hostname from the reverse lookup of the IP address of the main connection.
          If this fails too, the hostname will be set to 'localhost.localdomain'.
          </para>
          <para><literal>dhcp</literal>: NetworkManager will update the transient hostname
          only with information coming from DHCP. No fallback nor reverse lookup will be

          the hostname is reset to the last hostname set outside NetworkManager or
          'localhost' if none valid is there.
          </para>

        dnsmasq instance by adding them to files in the
        "<filename>&sysconfdir;/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/</filename>"
        directory. Note that when multiple upstream servers are
        available, dnsmasq will initially contact them in parallel and
        then use the fastest to respond, probing again other servers

        <literal>[connection-wlan-other]</literal>, and <literal>[connection]</literal>.
        When checking for a default configuration value, the sections are searched until
        the requested value is found.
        In the example above, "ipv4.route-metric" for wlan0 interface is set to 50,
        and for all other Wi-Fi typed interfaces to 55. Also, Wi-Fi devices would have
        IPv6 private addresses enabled by default, but other devices would have it disabled.
        Note that also "wlan0" gets "ipv6.ip6-privacy=1", because although the section
        "[connection-wifi-wlan0]" matches the device, it does not contain that property
        and the search continues.

        When having different sections in multiple files, sections from files that are read
        later have higher priority. So within one file the priority of the sections is

            <para>
              Specify the timeout for waiting for carrier in milliseconds.
              When the device loses carrier, NetworkManager does not react
              immediately. Instead, it waits for this timeout before considering
              the link lost. Also, on startup, NetworkManager considers the
              device as busy for this time, as long as the device has no carrier.
              This delays startup-complete signal and NetworkManager-wait-online.
              Configuring this too high means to block NetworkManager-wait-online
              longer then necessary. Configuring it too low, means that NetworkManager
              will declare startup-complete, although carrier is about to come
              and auto-activation to kick in.
              The default is 5000 milliseconds.

            <para>
              Specify devices for which NetworkManager will (partially)
              ignore the carrier state. Normally, for
              device types that support carrier-detect, such as Ethernet
              and InfiniBand, NetworkManager will only allow a
              connection to be activated on the device if carrier is
              present (ie, a cable is plugged in), and it will
              deactivate the device if carrier drops for more than a few
              seconds.
            </para>
            <para>
              A device with carrier ignored will allow activating connections on
              that device even when it does not have carrier, provided
              that the connection uses only statically-configured IP
              addresses. Additionally, it will allow any active
              connection (whether static or dynamic) to remain active on
              the device when carrier is lost.

            <para>
              Note that the "carrier" property of NMDevices and device D-Bus
              interfaces will still reflect the actual device state; it's just

            <para>

        The settings "match-device" and "stop-match" are available to match a device section
        on a device. The order of multiple sections is also top-down within the file and

    <title><literal>connectivity</literal> section</title>

    <para>This section controls NetworkManager's optional connectivity
    checking functionality.  This allows NetworkManager to detect
    whether or not the system can actually access the internet or
    whether it is behind a captive portal.</para>

    <para>Connectivity checking serves two purposes. For one, it exposes
    a connectivity state on D-Bus, which other applications may use. For example,
    Gnome's portal helper uses this as signal to show a captive portal login
    page.
    The other use is that default-route of devices without global connectivity
    get a penalty of +20000 to the route-metric. This has the purpose to give a
    better default-route to devices that have global connectivity. For example,
    when being connected to WWAN and to a Wi-Fi network which is behind a captive
    portal, WWAN still gets preferred until login.</para>

    <para>Note that your distribution might set <literal>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/*/rp_filter</literal> to
    strict filtering. That works badly with per-device connectivity checking,
    which uses SO_BINDDEVICE to send requests on all devices. A strict rp_filter
    setting will reject any response and the connectivity check on all but the
    best route will fail.</para>

# Match against the maximum allowed version. The example matches
